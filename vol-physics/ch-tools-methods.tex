\section{Tools and Methods Employed for Calibration }
\label{sec:phys-tools-calib}

\fixme{(from SG email 1 Oct about the outline) "We also think a section called calibration tools and methods in the “Tools and Methods Employed” chapter is useful so we can list calibration related tools and methods here. We envision this chapter including dedicated tools that we are currently developing for alignment related effects, E-field effects and for LBL propagation. It is possible that we may be able to absorb this in calibration detector chapters but we would like to keep this as a placeholder for now."}
