* Building the documents

There are many ways to do this.  

** Official build

The full, official build method uses the provided ~waf~ command.  It
is fast, portable and performs many tasks.  Primarily the volume PDF
files are built with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf configure
  $ ./waf
#+END_EXAMPLE

In addition you can build per-chapter PDFs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf --chapters
#+END_EXAMPLE

The results are ~build/volume-*-chapter-*.pdf~.

You can also prepare a tar file with just the files for each volume.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf --arxiv
#+END_EXAMPLE

In all cases, the produced files are found under ~build/~.
