Those commands may be distributed during physics data taking or during special calibration data taking sessions. The DAQ shall trigger and acquire data at a fixed, configurable interval after the distribution of the commands, in order to capture the response of the detector to calibration stimuli.  &   &  Calibration is essential to attain required detector performance comprehension. &  Techniques for doing this have been run successfully in MicroBooNE and ProtoDUNE.  \\ \colhline
