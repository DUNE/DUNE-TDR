    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-PDS-13}{ spec:pds-datarate } & Name: Data transfer from SP-PD to DAQ \\
    Description & <8 Gbps per DAQ input.     \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $<$\SI{8}{Gbps} \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Maximum data throughput from each PD front end board. Driven by the ability of the DAQ to receive data from the PD.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Maximum output from the photon detector front end is 10 MB/s, well below the DAQ requirement.  \\
