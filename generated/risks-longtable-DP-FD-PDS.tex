ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-01 & Insufficient light yield due to inefficient PDS design & Increase PMT photo-cathode coverage and/or WLS reflector foils coverage. & L & M & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-02 & Poor coating quality for \dword{tpb} coated surfaces and \dword{lar} contamination by \dword{tpb} & Test quality and ageing properties of TPB coating techniques. Elaborate improved techniques if needed. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-03 & \dword{pmt} channel loss due to faulty \dword{pmt} base design & Optimize clustering algorithms. Improve \dword{pmt} base design from analysis of possible failure modes in \dword{pddp}. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-04 & Bad \dword{pmt} channel due to faulty connection between \dword{hv}/signal cable and \dword{pmt} base & Optimize clustering algorithms. Connectivity tests in \lntwo prior to installation. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-05 & \dword{pmt} signal saturation & Tuning of \dword{pmt} gain. In worst case, redesign front-end to adjust to analog input range of ADC. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-06 & Excessive electronics noise to distinguish \dword{lar} scintillation light & Measurement of noise levels during commissioning prior to \lar filling. Modifications to grounding, shielding, or power distribution schemes. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-07 & Availability of resources for work at the installation/integration site less than planned & Move people temporarily from institutions involved in the \dword{pds} consortium to the integration/installation site. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-08 & Damage of \dwords{pmt} during shipment to the experiment site & Special packaging to avoid possible \dword{pmt} damage during shipment. Contingency of 10\% spare  \dwords{pmt}. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-09 & Damage of optical fibers during installation & Fibers will be last DP-PDS item to be installed. Detailed documentation for all DP-PDS installation tasks.   & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-10 & Excessive exposure to ambient light of \dword{tpb} coated surfaces, resulting in degraded performance & \dword{tpb} coated surfaces temporarily covered until cryostat closing. Detailed installation procedure to minimize exposure to ambient light. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-11 & \dword{pmt} implosion during \dword{lar} filling & No mitigation necessary, considering \SI{7}{bar} pressure rating of \dwords{pmt} and experience with same/similar \dwords{pmt} in other large liquid detectors. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-12 & Insufficient light yield due to poor \dword{lar} purity & Procurement of \dword{lar} from the manufacturer will require less than 3 ppM in nitrogen. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-13 & \dword{pmt} channel or \dword{pds} sector loss due to failures in \dword{hv}/signal rack & Ease of maintenance outside cryostat and availability of spares for all components of at least one \dword{hv}/signal rack. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-14 & Unstable response of the photon detection system over the lifetime of the experiment & Channel-level instabilities corrected via light calibration system. Detector-level instabilities corrected via cosmic-ray muon calibration data. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-15 & Bubbles from heat in \dwords{pmt} or resistors cause \dword{hv} discharge of the cathode & Verify the power density of the \dword{pmt} bases are within specifications. Monitor and interlock \dword{pmt} power supply currents. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-16 & Reflector/\dword{wls} panel assemblies together with the \dword{fc} walls can swing in the fluid flow & Allow appropriate open areas within/between reflector/\dword{wls} panel assemblies to minimize drag. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
