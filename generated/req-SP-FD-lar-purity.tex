                & Name: Liquid argon purity    \\ 
    Description & The LAr purity shall remain lower than \larpurity (with a goal of < \larpuritygoal). This corresponds to e- lifetime of 3 (10) ms.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  < \larpurity  ( < \larpuritygoal ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Liquid argon purity directly impacts the number of electrons received at the APA collection wires and hence the S/N.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Liquid argon purity will be measured via dedicated purity monitors and through different analysis techniques.  We will have the ability to operate at different purity levels to study its effects on track reconstruction and HVS stability.  \\
