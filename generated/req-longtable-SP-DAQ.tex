  Label & Description  & Specification \newline (Goal) & Rationale & Validation \\  \colhline


  \newtag{SP-DAQ-1}{ spec:trigger-high-energy }  & The detector shall trigger on the visible energy of underground physics events from decays or interactions within the active volume with high efficiency.  &  $>$\SI{100}{\MeV} &  Driven by DUNE physics mission. &  Simulations \\ \colhline
    
    

  \newtag{SP-DAQ-2}{ spec:trigger-low-energy }  & The detector shall be capable of triggering on the visible energy of single low energy neutrino interactions inside the active volume.  &  $>$\SI{10}{\MeV} &  Driven by DUNE physics mission. &  Simulations \\ \colhline
    
    

  \newtag{SP-DAQ-3}{ spec:trigger-beam }  & The detector shall trigger on the visible energy of beam interactions within the active volume with efficiency high enough that it has a sub-dominant impact on physics sensitivity.  &  $>$\SI{100}{\MeV} &  Driven by DUNE physics mission. &  Simulations, experience from past and ongoing experiments. \\ \colhline
    
    

  \newtag{SP-DAQ-4}{ spec:trigger-calibration }  & The detector shall provide triggers to and trigger on calibration stimuli and tag the data from these triggers as such  &   &  Need to understand detector performance. &  Experience from past and ongoing experiments \\ \colhline
    
    

  \newtag{SP-DAQ-5}{ spec:trigger-snb }  & A trigger shall be generated when a collection of signals is detected that constitute a candidate supernova burst with high galactic coverage, while meeting offline storage requirements and overall bandwidth limitations.  &   &  Driven by DUNE physics mission. &  Simulations \\ \colhline
    
    

  \newtag{SP-DAQ-6}{ spec:data-record }  & The DAQ shall merge data into a form suitable for offline analysis. Furthermore, tags shall be provided to allow the data collection conditions at the time and the livetime to be determined.  &   &  Needed for offline analysis. &  Common experimental practice. \\ \colhline
    
    

  \newtag{SP-DAQ-7}{ spec:deadtime }  & The DAQ shall operate with deadtime that does not contribute significantly to overall loss of detector livetime.  &   &  Driven by DUNE physics mission. &   \\ \colhline
