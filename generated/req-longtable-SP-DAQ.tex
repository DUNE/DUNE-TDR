\rowcolor{dunesky}
\newtag{SP-DAQ-1}{ spec:trigger-high-energy } & Name: Off-beam High-energy Trigger \\ 
    Description & The detector shall trigger on the visible energy of underground physics events from decays or interactions within the active volume with high efficiency.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $>$\SI{100}{\MeV} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Below top-level: data-rate-to-tape. Energy here is "visible energy", defined as deposited energy in the active volume as ionization and/or scintillation.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
   \colhline
\rowcolor{dunesky}
\newtag{SP-DAQ-2}{ spec:trigger-low-energy } & Name: Off-beam Low-energy Trigger \\ 
    Description & The detector shall be capable of triggering on the visible energy of single low energy neutrino interactions inside the active volume.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $>$\SI{10}{\MeV} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Below top-level: data-rate-to-tape. Energy here is "visible energy", defined as deposited energy in the active volume as ionization and/or scintillation.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
   \colhline
\rowcolor{dunesky}
\newtag{SP-DAQ-3}{ spec:trigger-beam } & Name: Trigger for Beam \\ 
    Description & The detector shall trigger on the visible energy of beam interactions within the active volume with efficiency high enough that it has a sub-dominant impact on physics sensitivity.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $>$\SI{100}{\MeV} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Below top-level: data-rate-to-tape. Energy here is "visible energy", defined as deposited energy as ionization and/or scintillation.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
   \colhline

\newtag{SP-DAQ-4}{ spec:trigger-calibration } & Name: Trigger for Calibration \\ 
    Description & The detector shall provide triggers to and trigger on calibration stimuli and tag the data from these triggers as such   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &   \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Below top-level: data-rate-to-tape, can add top level requirements for understanding uniformity, etc.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
   \colhline
\rowcolor{dunesky}
\newtag{SP-DAQ-5}{ spec:trigger-snb } & Name: Trigger for Supernova Burst \\ 
    Description & A trigger shall be generated when a collection of signals is detected that constitute a candidate supernova burst with high galactic coverage, while meeting offline storage requirements and overall bandwidth limitations.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &   \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Below top-level: sn-trigger  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
