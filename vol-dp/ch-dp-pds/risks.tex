\section{Risks}
\label{sec:dp-pds-risks}

Table~\ref{tab:dppd_t_12_1} summarizes the risks associated with the \dual \dword{pds}. Severity level assigned for each risk is indicated as L (low), M (medium), and H (high). Below, we discuss these risks and mitigation plans for each risk item.

\begin{enumerate}

\item During \dword{fd} operation, the photon detection system could show performance fluctuations. For example, the \dword{pmt} gains could change. Continuous monitoring with the \dword{pmt} calibration system will enable us to resolve these issues individually for each \dword{pmt}.

\item Filling the detector with \dword{lar} could be a critical issue because a \dword{pmt} could implode. If this happens, the detector must be emptied. Special care must be taken during the filling of the detector with \dword{lar}. Pressure tests will be performed to quantify this.

\item Fibers are fragile and could be broken during installation because of the high number of fibers in the detector. Personnel in charge of assembling the different parts of the detector must take special care during fiber installation.

\item If external noise or light sources affect the \dwords{pmt}, measuring the signals without oscillations over the baseline could be difficult. Grounding, shielding, and power distribution are critical to the success of the experiment. Mitigation will require using proper shielding techniques on all cables and validating the noise performance of all equipment during installation and commissioning.

\item If we must increase the \dword{pmt} \dword{hv} to get higher gains, \dword{pmt} front-end inputs could be saturated. Then, we would lose a number of events during acquisition. To mitigate this risk, we will avoid operating the \dwords{pmt} at very high voltages. A balance between gain and saturation will be chosen.

\item The \dword{fd} construction cost estimate assumes that qualified local labor can be identified for certain activities. The cost will increase if external labor is required. Labor costs might need to increase to attract qualified candidates. Labor resources from laboratories may need to be housed and used. We will ensure that sufficient funding is available to move people temporarily from institutions involved in the \dword{pds} consortium to the integration/installation site.

\item If \dwords{pmt} are not packaged properly, they could be damaged during shipment. In this case, the \dword{pmt} cannot be used in the detector. We will use special packaging to avoid possible damage to the \dwords{pmt} during shipment. In any case, we will have a \num{10}\% contingency spare \dwords{pmt}.

\item Because of the long drift distance and the position of the cathode and ground grid on top of the \dwords{pmt}, the number of photons reaching the \dwords{pmt} might not be sufficient at some geometrical acceptances. Additional light collection enhancement tools are being considered to mitigate this effect. The most feasible option is to install wavelength shifting film on the inner surface of the \dword{fc}.

\item Choosing the wrong feedthrough means we could have higher noise levels or oscillations in the signals. Using the wrong parts might cause mechanical problems. Special care must be taken during the design of the screws and \dword{hv} feedthroughs needed for cabling in the detector. \dword{pddp} experience will be used to mitigate this risk.

\item While commissioning  the detector before \dword{lar} filling, excessive noise could appear because some components may fail because grounding rules are not observed. We will ensure that grounding rules are enforced and review any proposed modification of the detector design.

\item \dword{pmt} cables are soldered to the \dword{pmt} base and tested before installation. If the soldering is poorly done, some channels could show a bad waveform or no signal at all. Several tests will be done in the base before the \dwords{pmt} are installed: impedance, \dword{hv} tests in gas Ar to avoid sparks, and full test of the \dword{pmt} to verify signals are correct.

\item Limited past experience shows that the \dword{tpb} coating might not be sufficiently stable, possibly contaminating the \dword{lar} over the long term. We will carefully examine results from \dword{pddp} and other laboratory tests% as quickly as possible
. We will elaborate improved coating techniques if needed.
