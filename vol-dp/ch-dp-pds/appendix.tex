\section{Appendix - Alternatives}
\label{sec:dp-pds-appendix}

\subsection{Individual Ground Grids}
\label{sec:dp-pds-appendix-grid}

In collaboration with the \dword{hv} consortium, the installation of individual ground grids for each \dword{pmt} in place of the ground grid table structure is under consideration. Since the individual ground grid cages will potentially have thinner wires and they will be closer to the \dword{pmt} windows, generating a smaller sized shadow, they are expected to increase the acceptance of the \dwords{pmt}.

The feasibility of the design in terms of operation in the \dune \dual conditions will be studied by the \dword{hv} consortium. The design of the individual grids will be developed as a common effort of the two consortia engineering teams. The production of the grids will be done by \dword{hv} consortium. The grids will be installed at the \dword{itf} by \dual \dword{pd} consortium. The \dwords{pmt} will be installed with their individual grid cages by \dual \dword{pd} consortium. 

\subsection{Calibration System Alternatives}
\label{sec:dp-pds-appendix-calibration}

Alternatives to the baseline design of the calibration system described in Section~\ref{sec:dp-pds-calibration} will be pursued with R\&D measurements in order to make the system more effective, to reduce the cost and to mitigate issues related to the scaling to the \dune \dual size. These alternatives include reducing the amount of fibers, studying other options for the reference sensor, and increasing the input light if necessary. To reduce the number of fibers, light diffusers can be used, so that one fiber can illuminate at least 4 \dwords{pmt}. For instance, a diffuser could be placed at the ground grid, or in the case of individual ground grids, on the side walls. Apart from the diffusers, the considered alternatives are related to the external system and can be implemented with minimal interface with other subsystems.

\subsection{Wavelength Shifting Reflective Foils}
\label{sec:dp-pds-appendix-wlsfoils}

In order to enhance the light collection and improve the response uniformity in the detector volume, installation of wavelength shifting reflector foils on the \dword{fc} inner surfaces is under consideration. This alternative is being evaluated for two particular cases: The full coverage of the \dword{fc} inner walls with the foils and the coverage of only the upper half of the \dword{fc}. In addition to the complete evaluation of the physics impact within the consortium, the interface aspects such as the effect on the liquid circulation, the effective electric field and the mechanical structure are under discussion with the \dword{hv} consortium.
