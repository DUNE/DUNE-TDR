\section{Calibration Systems}
\label{sec:dp-calib-sys}

\dword{dune} plans to build two primary systems dedicated to calibrating the \dword{dp} far detector \dword{tpc}: a laser system
and a \dword{pns} system. The laser system should determine the \efield, mapping an essential parameter for describing the detector performance. 
Two laser systems are planned. 
With a high intensity laser, charge can be created in long straight tracks in the detector by direct ionization of \dword{lar} with the laser beams. This is described in Section~\ref{sec:dp-calib-sys-las-ion}. 
On the other hand, laser excitation of targets placed close to the cathode creates additional charge from well-defined locations that can be used to monitor the \dword{tpc}. This is described in Section~\ref{sec:dp-calib-sys-las-pe}. 
The \dword{pns} system is used to validate the low energy regime. This is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:dp-calib-sys-pns}.

The physics motivation, requirements and design of these systems are described in the following subsections.

%Two laser systems are planned. With a high intensity laser, charge can be created in long straight tracks in the detector by direct ionization of \dword{lar} with the laser beams. This is described in Section~\ref{sec:dp-calib-sys-las-ion}. On the other hand, laser excitation of targets placed in the cathode creates additional charge from well-defined locations that can be used to monitor the TPC. This is described in Section~\ref{sec:dp-calib-sys-las-pe}.
%The next sections describe the two subsystems based on these effects.
