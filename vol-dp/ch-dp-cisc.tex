\section{Introduction} 

%\fixme{SG/ACV: DONE.}

The \dword{cisc} consortium provides comprehensive monitoring for all detector components and for liquid and gaseous argon quality and behavior as well as a control system for many detector components. %The structure of the \dword{cisc} consortium is quite complex.
%The \dfirst{dpmod} uses the same control system and much of the same cryogenic instrumentation as the \dfirst{spmod} details of which can be found in the corresponding chapter of Volume~3 of this \dword{tdr}.
The \dword{dp} \dword{fd} uses the same control system as the SP module, as well as all SP cryogenic instrumentation. It also includes dedicated instrumentation for monitoring temperature and pressure in the gas phase. The gaseous argon instrumentation includes pressure meters and a vertical array of thermometers. A detailed description of instrumentation used in the \dword{spmod} can be found in the corresponding chapter of Volume~3 of this \dword{tdr}.

%\fixme{CP: Volume~4 is CISC-DP, this sentence must be removed; SG: I think in SP we say look at DP and DP we say look at SP for full details. I changed Vol. 4 to Vol. 3 referring to SP} 
%A detailed list of instrumentation differences may be found in the corresponding chapter of Volume~3 of this \dword{tdr}. 

The consortium responsibilities are split into 
two main branches: cryogenics instrumentation and slow controls (see Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-subsystem-chart}). 
% provides a subsystem chart for the \dword{cisc} system.

%\dword{cisc} has  The former includes a set of instrumentation devices to monitor the quality and behavior of the \lar volume in the cryostat interior, ensuring correct functioning of the full cryogenics system and suitability of the \lar for good quality physics data. The second branch of \dword{cisc} is the slow controls (SC) system, in charge of monitoring and controlling most detector elements. %, as described below. 
%\fixme{Tim's text starts here}
Each element of \dword{cisc} contributes to the DUNE physics program primarily by maintaining high detector live time.  As described in Volume~2 of this \dword{tdr}, neutrino \dword{cpv} and resolution of the neutrino mass hierarchy over the full range of possible neutrino oscillation parameters will require at least a decade of running the \dword{fd}.  Similar requirements apply to searches for nucleon decay and \dword{snb} events from within our galaxy.  Throughout this long run time, the interior of any DUNE cryostat remains completely inaccessible.  Repairs cannot be made to any damaged components within the TPC structure; hence, environmental conditions that present risks must be detected and reported quickly and reliably. 
 
%\fixme{CP: These risks specific for SP, to modify; SG: I modified this paragraph, please check; CP: I added a sentence; SG: good addition CP, this looks good to me.} 
Detector damage risks peak during the initial fill of a module with \lar because temperature gradients take on their highest values during this phase.  For example, thermal contractions outside of the range of design expectations could result in broken extraction grid wires or poor connections at the cathode \dword{hv} feedthrough point that could lead to unstable \efield{}s. 
%broken \dword{apa} wires, \dwords{sipm} in \dwords{pd} that detach from the \dword{xarapu} light detectors, or 
Additional care is needed to monitor the
gas phase above the liquid level. The temperature and the pressure of the gas phase affect gas density, and consequently, the large electron multiplier (LEM) gain calibration. These considerations require a robust temperature monitoring system for the detector both in liquid and gas phase and a pressure monitoring system in the gas phase,  
%\todo{SG: list out devices for both temperature and pressure, and say liquid and gas phase} 
supplemented with liquid level monitors and a high-performance camera system for visual inspection of the interior of the cryostat during the filling process.  These systems are fully described in Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-cryo-instr} of this chapter.
 
Argon purity must be established as early as possible in the filling process, a period during which gas analyzers are most useful, and must maintain an acceptable value, corresponding to a minimum electron drift lifetime of \SI{3}{ms} %\todo{SG: the lifetime value needs to updated for DP}, 
throughout the data-taking period. Dedicated purity monitors (Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-purity-mon}) provide precise lifetime measurements up to values of \SI{10}{ms} (current capability based on \dfirst{pdsp}). Purity requirements are more stringent in a dual phase detector due to longer drift paths, so \dword{cisc} plans to build longer purity monitors to increase this capability to approximately \SI{20}{ms} for the \dword{dp} \dword{fd}.
%,\todo{this will be longer for DP; contact Laura, Alan, Pordes, Jianming; modify the presentation.} the range over which electron attenuation most affects \dword{s/n} in the TPC. 
The purity monitors and gas analyzers remain important even after high lifetime has been achieved because periodic detector top-off  fills occur; the new \lar must be very high quality to be introduced into the cryostat.
 
 
%\fixme{ DD: Yes. if the level goes down, we need to switch off the extraction grid.
%Distance between extraction grid and liquid level: 5 mm below liquid level?
%The motor system in the CRP has a range of 4 cm down, so there should be a HV interlock about 4 cm below the nominal. 
%In ProtoDUNE-DP LAr level is controlled by high precision capacitive level %meters attached to the wall. We should see if this is the same for DUNE FD-DP
%This is an important difference compared to SP
%}

%\fixme{ACV: good for the 1st draft the sentece about the level}
The \dword{cisc} system must prevent fault conditions that could develop in the \dword{detmodule} over long periods of operation.
%\fixme{CP: specific for SP, to modify; SG: I don't know enough about DP to edit this. ACV is fixing this "[[ ]]"}
A drop in liquid level could affect the behavior of the extraction grid, which lies 5 mm below the liquid surface; the liquid level monitors must head off this possibility.  Very slow-developing outgassing phenomena could conceivably occur, with associated bubble generation creating another source of \dword{hv} breakdown events.
The cold camera system allows bubbling sites to be detected and identified, and mitigation strategies to be developed such as reducing \dword{hv} operation for some time.  A more subtle  fault is the formation of quasi-stable eddies in argon fluid flow that could prevent positive argon ions from being cleared from \dword{tpc} volume, resulting in space charge build up that would not otherwise be expected at the depth of the \dword{fd}.  The space charge could in turn cause distortions in the \dword{tpc} drift field that degrade tracking and calorimetry performance.  The high-performance thermometry  of the DUNE \dword{cisc} system creates input for well developed complex fluid flow models described in Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-cryo-cfd} that should enable detecting conditions associated with these eddies.
 
Finally, a high detector live-time fraction for operation over several years cannot be achieved without an extensive system for monitoring all aspects of detector performance, reporting this information intelligently to detector operators, and archiving the data for deeper offline studies.  Section~\ref{sec:dp-cisc-slowctrl} details the \dword{dune} slow controls system designed for this task.
%\todo{say also that PD-SP validation can be used for DP nominally and in the validation section, provide more specific details for all these.}

%\fixme{SG: I edited the below for DP} 
Some of the baseline designs for the \dword{cisc} systems (e.g., pressure meters in gas, capacitive level meters, slow controls system) have been used in \dword{pddp}, % designs arethe baseline for all \lar instrumentation devices, and %requirements for 
and corresponding design parameters are extrapolated from these designs. For systems that are currently not deployed in \dword{pddp}, the goal is deploy them in \dword{pddp}-Run-II phase. The \dword{pddp} data from Run-I and Run-II will be used to validate the instrumentation designs and to understand their performance. For some of the \dword{cisc} systems (e.g., static and dynamic T-gradient thermometers, purity monitors), validation and performance in \dword{pdsp} will provide important inputs to \dword{dp} \dword{fd}. More details are provided in sections~\ref{sec:pddp-cfd-valid}, \ref{sec:pddp-cryo-valid}, and \ref{sec:cisc-slow-control-pdsp}.

Cryogenics instrumentation includes purity monitors, various types of temperature monitors (gas and liquid phase), capacitive level meters, pressure meters (gas phase), and cameras with their associated light emitting systems. Also included are %components like 
gas analyzers and differential pressure level monitors that are directly related to the external cryogenics system, which have substantial interfaces with the \dword{lbnf}. \dword{lbnf} provides the needed expertise for these systems and is responsible for the design, installation, and commissioning, while the \dword{cisc} consortium provides the resources and supplements labor as needed.

\subsubsection{Slow Controls}
\label{sec:dp-cisc-slowctrl}
The slow controls portion of \dword{cisc} comprises three main components: 
%\fixme{figure shows 4, changed 3 to 4 here. [Carmen] we are changing the figure. [Glenn: figure changed]} 
hardware, infrastructure, and software. The slow controls hardware and infrastructure comprises networking hardware, signal processing hardware, computing hardware, and associated rack infrastructure. The slow controls software provides, for every slow control quantity, the central slow controls processing architecture, databases, alarms, archiving, and control room displays.

%\subsection{Scope} - moved up

%As described in the previous section, and shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-subsystem-chart}, the scope of the \dword{cisc} system spans a broad range of activities. 


%For slow controls, 
\dword{cisc} provides software and infrastructure for controlling and monitoring all detector elements that provide data on the health of the \dword{detmodule} or conditions important to the experiment, as well as  certain hardware. Slow controls includes the systems detailed below.

%\textbf{Slow controls base software and databases:}
Slow controls base software and databases are the central tools needed to develop
control and monitoring for various detector systems and interfaces. These include
\begin{itemize}
\item base input/output software;
\item alarms, archiving, display panels, and similar operator interface tools; and 
\item slow controls system documentation and operations guidelines.
\end{itemize}

%\textbf{Slow controls for external systems:} 
Slow controls for external systems collect data from systems
external to the \dword{detmodule} and provide status monitoring to operators
and for archiving. %These systems include 
They %will 
collect data on beam status, cryogenics status,
\dword{daq} status, facilities systems status, interlock
status bit monitoring (but not the actual interlock mechanism), ground
impedance monitoring, and possibly building and detector hall
monitoring, as needed.

%\textbf{Slow controls for detector hardware systems:}\
Slow controls for detector hardware systems %develop 
covers software interfaces for detector hardware devices:
\begin{itemize}
\item monitoring and control of all power supplies,
\item full rack monitoring (rack fans, thermometers and rack protection system),
\item \dword{cisc} instrumentation device monitoring (and control to the extent needed),
\item calibration device monitoring (and control to the extent needed),
\item \dword{crp} instrumentation device monitoring (and control to the extent needed),
\item power distribution unit and computer hardware monitoring,
\item \dword{hv} system monitoring through cold cameras, and
\item inspection of detector components using warm cameras.
\end{itemize}
%
%\textbf{Slow controls hardware:} 
\dword{cisc} will develop, install, and commission any hardware related to rack monitoring and control for the detector racks. Most power supplies may only require a cable from the device
to an Ethernet switch, but some power supplies might require special cables (e.g., GPIB or RS232) for communication. The \dword{cisc} consortium will provide these control cables.

%In addition to the listed activities, 
\dword{cisc} %also has 
participates in additional activities outside the scope of the consortium that require coordination with other groups. This is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:interfaces}.

%\subsection{Requirements}
\subsection{Design Considerations}
%\fixme{SG: Done editing the text pending updating top-level reqs. table.}
 
%Some common 
Important design considerations for instrumentation devices include stability, reliability, and longevity, so that devices can survive for at least \dunelifetime. %For any device to have 
Such longevity %a long lifetime 
is uncommon for any device, so the overall design allows replacing devices where possible. %A requirement common to every element inside the cryostat is that 
\dword{dune} requires the \efield on any instrumentation devices inside the cryostat to be less than \localefield to minimize the risk of dielectric breakdown in \lar. %To avoid confusing event reconstruction, we include another important design parameter that should be evaluated in \dword{pdsp}: the maximum noise level induced by instrumentation devices on the readout electronics that can be tolerated. 

An important consideration for event reconstruction is the maximum noise level, induced by instrumentation devices, that the readout electronics  can tolerate. \dword{pddp} is evaluating this. Table~\ref{tab:specs:DP-CISC} shows the selected top-level specifications for \dword{cisc} subsystems. 
%\todo{SG: Table 1.1 needs to be updated with DP-specific requirements if any. ACV/SG following up.} 
Tables~\ref{tab:fdgen-slow-cryo-requirements-1}, \ref{tab:fdgen-slow-cryo-requirements-2}, and \ref{tab:fdgen-slow-cryo-requirements-3} show the full set of specifications %requirements for the \dword{cisc} subsystems.
for the \dword{cisc} subsystems.
\fixme{2nd draft: In table 1.1 and 1.2, need to update the precision on PrM and present it differently e.g. relative vs absolute}

Data from purity monitors and different types of thermometers will be used to validate the \lar fluid flow model. 
%A number of requirements drive the design parameters on the precision and granularity in their distribution across the cryostat. 
A number of requirements drive the design parameters for the precision and granularity of monitor distribution across the cryostat. 
%\fixme{CP: Is it true for DP?; SG: not sure about the lifetime part, need to confirm. @ACV: can you check the temperature part? I think the SP validation still applies here. Should we add that we plan to check performance in PD-DP-Run-II?.} 
For example, the electron lifetime measurement precision must be \SI{1.4}{\%} to keep the bias on the charge readout in the \dword{tpc} below \SI{0.5}{\%} at \SI{3}{ms} lifetime.
%~\todo{SG: this needs to be updated for DP.} 
 For thermometers, the %requirements 
parameters are driven by \dword{pdsp} and  \dword{pddp} designs as well as the comparison of \dword{pdsp} data to \dword{cfd} simulations. The temperature measurement resolution in liquid phase must be less than \SI{2}{mK}, and the relative precision of those measurements must be less than \SI{5}{mK}. The resolution is defined as the temperature \dword{rms} for individual measurements and is driven by the electronics. The relative precision also includes the effect of reproducibility for successive immersions in \dword{lar}. 
The relative precision is particularly important in characterizing %because 
gradients less than \SI{20}{mK}. % should be characterized.  
As described below, the laboratory calibration data and the recent analysis of thermometer instrumentation data from \dword{pdsp} shows that a \SI{2.5}{mK} relative precision is achievable. 

%\fixme{AC: Paragraph below to be reviewed; SG: I reviewed this and added information on level meters and temp/pressure meters in gas phase, please check.}

It is also important to monitor the temperature and pressure in the gas phase over the liquid phase because they affect the \dword{lem} gain calibration. The gas pressure must be monitored to 1~mbar precision and accuracy. Near the surface of the liquid, the temperature gradient of the gas must be measured with an array of temperature probes with a vertical pitch that increases with height (from 1 to 5 cm). The \dword{lar} differential pressure level meters must be precise to \SI{14}{mm} to measure accurately during filling. 
%This precision is also sufficient to ensure that the \dword{lar} level stays above the \dwords{gp} of a \dfirst{sp} module.
Moreover, multiple capacitive level meters with less than 5~mm precision will be needed to more precisely measure the \lar level and for \lar-level based interlocks for other systems (e.g., \dword{hv}).  
%along the top of the fluid to maintain correct depth of the gas phase\todo{SG to fix this.}. 

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:fdgen-slow-cryo-requirements-2}, several requirements drive the design of cold and warm cameras and the associated light emitting system. The components of the camera systems must not contaminate the \lar or produce bubbles % when the \dword{hv} 
to avoid  increasing the risk of \dword{hv} discharge. Both cold and warm cameras must provide coverage of at least \SI{80}{\%} of the \dword{tpc} volume

with a resolution of \SI{1}{cm} for cold cameras and \SI{2}{mm} for warm cameras on the \dword{tpc}.

details  are in Table~\ref{tab:fdgen-slow-cryo-requirements-1}.

For slow controls, the system must %be designed to 
be sufficiently robust to monitor 
a minimum of 150,000  variables and 
support a broad range of monitoring and archiving rates. The system must also %be capable of an 
interface with a large number of detector subsystems and %to 
establish two-way communication with them for control and monitoring.

\fixme{Within Table 1.1 itself, I see a few corrections that should be made. First, the right justify in the columns labeled Rationale and Validation should be eliminated for easier reading.

\subsection{Fluid Dynamics Simulation}
\label{sec:fdgen-cryo-cfd}

%\fixme{SG/ACV:DONE}

 Proper placement of purity monitors, thermometers, and liquid level monitors within the \dword{detmodule} requires knowing how \lar flows within the cryostat, given its fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer, and distribution of impurity concentrations. Fluid flow is also important in understanding how the positive and negative ion excess created by various sources (e.g., ionization from cosmic rays and $^{36}$Ar; ion feedback at the liquid-gas interface in a \dword{dp} detector) is distributed across the detector as it affects \efield uniformity.

Fluid motion within the cryostat is driven primarily by small changes in density caused by thermal gradients within the fluid although pump flow rates and inlet and outlet locations also contribute. Heat sources include exterior heat from the surroundings, interior heat from electronics, and heat flow through the pump inlet. In principle, purity monitors can be placed throughout the cryostat to determine if the argon is pure enough for experimentation. However, some areas inside the cryostat are off limits for such monitors. 
% \fixme{anne moved prev pgraph up --- looks good [Glenn, Carmen, Sowjanya]}

To determine the purity of the argon in regions where experimental data is unavailable, \dword{cfd} simulations can be used to better understand and quantify impurity levels. The overall goal of the \dword{cfd} simulations
%\dword{dune} \dword{fd} 
%for the \dword{spmod} 
is to better understand and predict the fluid (in either liquid or vapor state) motions and the implications for detector performance. % of the detectors. 
The fluid flow behavior can be determined by simulating \dword{lar} flow within a \dword{detmodule} %the detector 
using Siemens Star-CCM$+$\footnote{https://mdx.plm.automation.siemens.com/star-ccm-plus}, a commercially available \dword{cfd} code.  Such a model must properly define the fluid characteristics, solid bodies, and fluid-solid interfaces, as well as provide a way to measure contamination, while still maintaining reasonable computation times. In addition, these fluid dynamics simulations can be compared to available experimental data to assess simulation accuracy and credibility. 

%\fixme{seems like the above is sp/dp independent but the next stuff isn't. anne. The text has been modified [Carmen and Glenn] --- we think this is fixed.}
Although simulation of the \dword{detmodule} presents challenges, %there are 
acceptable simplifications can %to 
accurately represent the fluid, the interfacing solid bodies, and variations of contaminant concentrations. Because of the magnitude of thermal variation within the cryostat, modeling the \lar is simplified by using constant thermophysical properties, calculating buoyant force with the Boussinesq Model (using a constant density for the fluid with application of a temperature-dependent buoyant force), and a standard shear stress transport turbulence model. Solid bodies that touch the \lar include the cryostat wall, photon detectors, and light reflector foils.  
%anode planes, \dword{gp}, \todo{this is okay but would be good to expand the list with DP specific examples} and \dword{fc}. 
%As in previous \dword{cfd} models of the \dword{dune} 35-ton prototype and \dword{pdsp}%{protodune} 
%\fixme{Another abbreviation that may need to be coded in Latex. {\em Or it might be better to remove repeated references to SDSU and FNAL here. Why are we focusing attention in the technical section on distinguishing between FNAL and SDSU CFD simulations? --Glenn. Anselmo: I think we can remove SDSU in the previous sentence and also below( and FNAL). Institutions should be only mentioned in the section about organization and management. This was probably important when SDSU was not part of the consortium. } {\bf Carmen working on this.}}
%\cite{bib:docdb5915}, 
The \dword{fc} planes, cathode planes, and grounding grid can be represented by porous bodies. Because impurity concentration and electron lifetime do not affect fluid flow, these variables can be simulated as passive scalars, as is commonly done for smoke released \cite{cfd-1} 
in air or dyes released in liquids.

% top pgraph in section was taken from here. Anne

Discrepancies between real data and simulations may affect detector performance. % because 
Simulation results contribute to decisions about where to place sensors and monitors and to %as well as 
the definitions of various calibration quantities. Methods of mitigating such risks include well established convergence criteria, sensitivity studies, and comparison to results of previous \dword{cfd} simulation work. Moreover, the simulation will be improved with input from temperature measurements and validation tests from \dword{pdsp}\footnote{Because \dword{pddp} was not instrumented with high-precision thermometers in the liquid phase and because the cryogenics design is the same for \dword{sp} and \dword{dp} modules of the \dword{dune} \dword{fd}, \dword{pdsp} data will be used to validate the liquid \dword{cfd} model.}. 

%\todo{add a sentence here that CFD validation from SP is useful to DP as well, reiterate what we say in Pd validation.}

The strategy for future \dword{cfd} simulations begins with
validating the \dword{cfd} model using \dword{pddp} \lar instrumentation data and modeling the \dword{fd} \dword{dpmod} to derive specifications for instrumentation. 
We are pursuing a prioritized set of studies to help determine requirements for other systems. We plan to

\item review the \dword{dune} \dword{dp} \dword{fd} cryogenics system design and verify the current implementation in simulation %to ensure that the model represents what will be built.

\item validate the liquid \dword{cfd} model using thermometer data from \dword{pdsp} because we have no high precision T-gradient thermometers in \dword{pddp} to validate the liquid model; 
\item model the \dword{pddp} gas regions with the same precision as the \dword{fd}. The gas model should how to place thermometers in the argon gas and verify the design of the gaseous argon purge system;

\subsubsection{Validation in \dword{protodune}}
\label{sec:pddp-cfd-valid}
%\fixme{SG: Done. ACV: checked}
%\fixme{AC: we will not have CFD validation in ProtoDUNE-DP, so I think we should keep the validation from ProtoDUNE-SP Here. Being the cryogenics systems and cryostats similar I think this is reasonable;}

Given the \dword{hv} configuration in \dword{pddp} is more complex than \dword{pdsp} (much higher electric potential and no zero field regions on the \dword{tpc} sides), \dword{pddp} was not instrumented with vertical arrays of high precision temperature sensors in the liquid as in \dword{pdsp}. These temperature sensors are important elements for validating \dword{cfd} simulations, but because the cryostat and cryogenics system designs are identical in both the \dword{sp} and \dword{dp} far detector modules, temperature data from \dword{pdsp} can be used to validate the liquid model for the \dword{dp} \dword{fd}. 
%under certain assumptions
For validating the gas model, data from the vertical array of thermometers installed in the \dword{pddp} will be used. 

\dword{pdsp} has collected data to validate the \dword{cfd} using % already installed instrumentation.
\begin{itemize}
\item static and dynamic T-gradient thermometers, 
\item individual temperature sensors placed in the return \lar inlets, 
\item two \twod grids of individual temperature sensors installed below the bottom ground planes and above the top ground planes, 
\item a string of three purity monitors vertically spaced from near the bottom of the cryostat to just below the \lar surface,
\item two pressure sensors (relative and absolute) in the argon gas,
\item H$_{2}$O, N$_{2}$, and O$_{2}$ gas analyzers, 
\item \dword{lar} level monitors, and
\item standard cryogenic sensors 
%including pressure transducers, 
and individual temperature sensors placed around
the cryostat on the membrane walls, and recirculation flow rates transducers.
\end{itemize}

On the other hand, \dword{pddp} has installed the following instrumentation devices to validate \dword{cfd}:

\begin{itemize}
%\item static and dynamic T-gradient thermometers, 
%\item individual temperature sensors placed in the return \lar inlets,\todo{ACV:I don't think this is the case} 
%\item two \twod grids of individual temperature sensors installed below the bottom ground planes and above the top ground planes, 
\item two purity monitors, one at the bottom of the cryostat and another 2~m from the bottom;
\item two pressure sensors (relative and absolute) in the argon gas;
%\todo{ACV: this is the case also for SP. We should probably add the same sentence there}
\item vertical array of thermometers in argon gas;
%\item a string of three purity monitors vertically spaced from near the bottom of the cryostat to just below the \lar surface
\item H$_{2}$O, N$_{2}$, and O$_{2}$ gas analyzers; 
\item \dword{lar} level monitors; and
\item standard cryogenic sensors 
%including pressure transducers\todo{ACV: pressure sensors mentioned above}, 
and individual temperature sensors placed around the cryostat on the membrane walls and recirculation flow rates transducers.

%The comparison with the dynamic T-gradient monitor data is just the first step in the validation. As described below, data from purity monitors and other temperature probes will be also used.

%Additional dedicated tests are also planned to validate the \dword{cfd} under various deliberate changes of the cryostat environment; measuring the instrumentation response may help establish the validity of the \dword{cfd} model.

These tests were not attempted during the beam run because even controlled changes of the cryostat environment could have undesirable effects. Some possible additional tests include pump/recirculation manipulations such as pump on/off, pumping speed change, and bypassing filtration. Additionally, changes in the pressure can be induced by setting the cryostat pressure set point to a higher (or lower) value\footnote{The HV could be ramped down for this exercise because dropping the pressure too fast might provoke boiling of the \lar near the surface.} for a specified time while monitoring the instrumentation.

\subsection{Purity Monitors}

%Laura, Jianming
A fundamental requirement of a \dword{lar} \dshort{tpc} is that ionization electrons drift over long distances in \dword{lar}. Part of the charge is inevitably lost because of electronegative impurities in the liquid. To keep this loss to a minimum, monitoring impurities and purifying the \dword{lar} during operation is essential.




A purity monitor is a small ionization chamber used to infer independently  the effective free electron lifetime in the \lartpc.  %Its operating principle %of the purity monitor 
%consists of generating a known electron current by illuminating a cathode with UV light, then at an anode, collecting  the current that survives after drifting a known distance.  Attenuation of the current is related to the lifetime of the electron.
%consists of 
It illuminates a cathode with UV light to generate a known electron current, then collects the drifted current at an anode a known distance away.  Attenuation of the current is related to the electron lifetime.
Electron loss can be parameterized as
%
\(N(t) = N(0)e^{-t/\tau},\)
%
where $N(0)$ is the number of electrons generated by ionization, $N(t)$ is the number of electrons after drift time $t$, and $\tau$ is the electron lifetime. 

For the \dword{dpmod}, the drift distance is \dpmaxdrift, and the \efield is \SI{500}{\volt\per\centi\meter}. Given the drift velocity of approximately \SI{1.5}{\milli\meter\per\micro\second} in this field, the time to go from cathode to anode is roughly \SI{\sim8}{\milli\second} \cite{Walkowiak:2000wf}.
For an \lar \dshort{tpc} signal attenuation, \([N(0)-N(t)]/N(0)\), of \SI{50}{\percent} over the entire drift distance,
%The \lar \dshort{tpc} signal attenuation, \([N(0)-N(t)]/N(0)\), must remain %be kept 
%less than \SI{20}{\percent} over the entire drift distance~\cite{bib:docdb3384}.  %\cite{fdtf-final-report}
 the corresponding electron lifetime is $\SI{8}{ms}/[-\ln(0.5)] \simeq \SI{11}{ms}$.
% (The corresponding \dword{lar} O2 purity requirement is about \SI{30}{ppt}.)

%Residual gas analyzers are an obvious choice when analyzing argon gas and can be used to monitor the gas in the ullage of the tank. 
Residual gas analyzers can monitor the gas in the ullage of the tank and would be an obvious choice for analyzing argon gas. 
Unfortunately, suitable and commercially available mass
spectrometers have a detection limit of \SI{\sim 10}{\dword{ppb}},
whereas \dword{dune} requires a sensitivity of \dword{ppt}. Therefore,
specially constructed and distributed purity monitors will measure \lar purity in all %the
phases of operation. % at several known positions.  
These measurements,
along with an accurate \dword{cfd} model, enable 
determining \dword{lar} purity at all positions throughout the \dword{detmodule}.
% [I rewrote the last sentence slightly to make clear how the purity monitor spatial resolution relates to spatial resolution of purity =Glenn (anne reworded slightly - I believe the message is still the same.]


Purity monitors also %serve to 
mitigate the risk of \lar contamination.  The large scale of the \dwords{detmodule} increases the risk of failing to notice a sudden, unexpected infusion of contaminated \lar %being injected 
back into the cryostat.   
If this condition were to persist, it could cause irreversible contamination to the \dword{lar} and terminate useful data taking.  Strategically placed purity monitors mitigate this risk as demonstrated in \dword{pdsp}. 

Purity monitors are placed inside the cryostat but outside the %detector 
\dword{tpc}. They are also placed  within the recirculation system outside the cryostat, both in front of and behind the filtration system. % before and after filtration. 
Continuous monitoring of  the \lar supply lines to the \dword{detmodule} provides a strong line of defense against %contaminated \lar. 
contamination from sources both in the \lar volume and from components in the recirculation system. 
Similarly, gas analyzers (described in Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-gas-anlyz}) %provide a first line of defense 
protect against contaminated gas.  
%Purity monitors inside the \dword{detmodule} provide critical defense against liquid argon contamination caused by pump and filter problems, as well as all sources of contamination in the \lar volume and contamination from recirculated \lar. 

Furthermore, using several purity monitors to measure lifetime with high precision at carefully chosen points provides key input, e.g.,  vertical gradients in impurity concentrations, for \dshort{cfd} models of the \dword{detmodule}.

Purity monitors were deployed in previous \dword{lartpc} experiments, i.e., ICARUS, \microboone, and the \dword{35t}. During the first run of the \dword{35t}, two of the four purity monitors stopped working during cooldown, and a third operated intermittently. We later found this was due to poor electrical contacts between the resistor chain and the purity monitor. A new design was implemented and successfully tested in the second run. 

%\fixme{CP: paragraph to be checked}

%Main differences with ProtoDUNE SP:
%- we will have three cathodes per PrM (two silver and one gold, gold is the standard choice; R\&D has shown silver emits more photoelectrons)

Figure~\ref{fig-pdsp-prmassembly} shows the assembly of the \dword{pdsp} purity monitors. The design reflects improvements to ensure electric connectivity and improve signals. \dword{pdsp} uses a string of purity monitors connected with stainless steel tubes to protect the optic fibers. The purity monitor system at \dword{pdsp} measured electron lifetime every hour during commissioning and daily during the beam test. During %commissioning and while running the test beam, 
this time, it %the purity monitor system at \dword{pdsp} 
alerted us to serious problems twice, first %. The first time was 
for filter saturation and %the second was 
then because the recirculation pump had stopped. This enabled us to prevent %These alerts were crucial to the success of running the test beam in the \dword{pdsp} project by preventing 
situations that otherwise could have had serious consequences.

\end{dunefigure}



During the commissioning and beam test of \dword{pdsp}, the purity monitors operated with different high voltages to change electron drift time, ranging from \SI{150}{\micro\second} to \SI{3}{\milli\second}. This allowed the \dword{pdsp} purity monitors to measure electron lifetime from \SI{35}{\micro\second} to about \SI{10}{\milli\second} with high precision, a dynamic range greater than \num{300}. %This high-precision electron lifetime measurement was also valuable to the lifetime calibration for  \dword{pdsp}. Because purity monitors have much smaller drift volumes than the \dshort{tpc}, they are less affected by the space charge caused by cosmic rays.

\subsubsection{Purity Monitor Design}
%Laura, Jianming
%WIP IF YOU HAVE MIP PARTICLES LIKE MUONS... NOT TRUE WHEN YOU ARE UNDERGROUND. ALSO, WE HAVE SEEN IN THE 311 THAT MUONS DO NOT DEPOSIT THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY ACROSS THE TRACK 
%While the \dword{lar} \dshort{tpc} itself can measure the purity of the liquid argon based on the drift electron lifetime, this can only be done once a certain level of purity has been achieved, and until then it may be unclear what the level of purity is and if conditions in the detector are becoming better or worse. 

%The basic design of a purity monitor uses the design in the ICARUS experiment ( Figure~\ref{fig:prm})\cite{Adamowski:2014daa}: a double-gridded ion chamber immersed in the \lar volume.   The purity monitor has four parallel, circular electrodes, a disk holding a photocathode, two grid rings (anode and cathode), and an anode disk. The cathode grid is held at ground potential. The cathode, anode grid, and anode are electrically accessible via modified vacuum grade high-voltage \fdth{}s and separate bias voltages held at each one.   The anode grid and the field shaping rings are connected to the cathode grid by an internal chain of \SI{50}{\mega\ohm} resistors to ensure the uniformity of the \efield{}s in the drift regions. A stainless mesh cylinder is used as a Faraday cage to isolate the purity monitor from external electrostatic background. 

%\fixme{CP: Subsection to be reviewed.}
The \dword{dpmod} baseline purity monitor design follows that of  the ICARUS experiment (Figure~\ref{fig:prm})\cite{Adamowski:2014daa}.  It consists of a double-gridded ion chamber immersed in the \lar volume with four parallel, circular electrodes, a disk holding a photocathode, two grid rings (anode and cathode), and an anode disk. The cathode grid is held at ground potential. The cathode, anode grid, and anode 
each hold separate bias voltages and are electrically accessible via modified vacuum-grade \dword{hv} \fdth{}s. % and separate bias voltages held at each one.   
The anode grid and the field shaping rings are connected to the cathode grid by an internal chain of \SI{50}{\mega\ohm} resistors to ensure the uniformity of the \efield{}s in the drift regions. A stainless mesh cylinder is used as a Faraday cage to isolate the purity monitor from external electrostatic background. 

The purity monitor measures the electron drift lifetime between its anode and cathode. The purity monitor's UV-illuminated %gold 
photocathode generates electrons via the photoelectric effect. Because electron lifetime in \lar is inversely proportional to the electronegative impurity concentration, the fraction of electrons generated at the cathode that arrives at the anode ($Q_A/Q_C$) after the electron drift time $t$ gives a measure of the electron lifetime $\tau$:
%
\( Q_A/Q_C \sim e^{-t/\tau}.\)



\begin{dunefigure}[Schematic diagram of the %basic 
baseline purity monitor design]{fig:prm}
  {Schematic diagram of the basic purity monitor design \cite{Adamowski:2014daa}.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{PrMon_prm.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}


%
%Complete formula would be: Q_A/Q_C = \frac{T_1 \sinh(t_3/2\tau)}{t_3 \sinh(t_1/2\tau)} \exp \left(-\frac{t_2+\frac{t_1+t_3}{2}}{\tau} \right), where$t_1$ is the time it takes the electrons to go from cathode to cathode grid, $t_2$ to go from cathode grid to anode grid, and $t_3$ to go from grid anode to anode. 

%This formula shows 
Once the electron lifetime becomes much larger than the drift time $t$, the purity monitor reaches its sensitivity limit.  For $\tau >> t$, the anode-to-cathode charge ratio becomes $\sim\,1$. Because the drift time is inversely proportional to the \efield, in principle, reducing the %drift 
field should make it possible to measure lifetimes of any length regardless of the length of the purity monitor.
%means any lifetime can be measured no matter the length of the purity monitor (the lower the field, the lower the drift velocity, i.e., the longer the drift time). 
On the other hand, increasing the voltage will shorten the drift time, allowing measurement of a short lifetime when purity is low. 

%According to our experience with \dword{pdsp}, for a 9.5 inch long purity monitor, varying the operational \dword{hv} on the anode from 250 V to 4000 V allows the purity monitors to measure an electron lifetime ranging from 35 $\mu$s to approximately 10 ms with high precision.

%Varying the operational \dword{hv} on the anode up to \SI{2000}{V} in the \dword{pddp}'s \SI{16}{cm} (6.5 inch) long purity monitor allowed us to make electron lifetime measurements of the order of few ms.
Varying the operational \dword{hv} on the anode from \SI{250}{V} to \SI{4000}{V} in the \dword{pdsp}'s \SI{24}{cm} (9.5 inch) long purity monitor allowed us to make the \SI{35}{\micro\second} to \SI{10}{\milli\second} electron lifetime measurements. 
%s ranging from 35 $\mu$s to approximately 10 ms with high precision.

%%% [Deleted this as confusing --- what is ``gas phase'' in single phase detector? --- and not needed. -Glenn] In practice, at very low fields, drifting the electrons all the way up to the anode is difficult, and the discharge in the gas phase limits the anode high voltage to go above 4000 V. \fixme{I read this as "the discharge in the gas phase keeps the voltage in the anode below 4000V." Is that correct? {\em No...}}

The electron lifetime of the purest commercial \lar, after the first filtering and during the filling process, is typically longer than \SI{40}{\micro\second}. However, when the filter starts to saturate, the lifetime decreases to less than \SI{30}{\micro\second}.  To %achieve less 
reduce the energy loss due to impurities,  the \dword{dpmod} requires an electron lifetime longer than \SI{10}{\milli\second}. Therefore, purity monitors with different lengths (drift distances) are needed to extend the measurable range to less than \SI{35}{\micro\second} and more than  \SI{10}{\milli\second}.
%Currently, specific sensitivity limits for purity monitors with a drift distance of the order of $\sim$\SI{20}{\centi\meter} are still to be determined in a series of tests. If the required sensitivity is not achieved by these ``short'' purity monitors, longer ones may be developed.

The photocathode that produces the \phel{}s is an aluminum plate coated first with \SI{50}{\angstrom} of titanium followed by \SI{1000}{\angstrom} of gold; it is attached to the cathode disk.
Three photocathodes per purity monitor are implemented in \dword{pddp}, two of silver and one of gold, with each cathode lit by one fiber. The gold cathode is the standard used in \dword{pdsp}, but R\&D has shown silver emits more photoelectrons.
A xenon flash lamp is the light source in the baseline design, although %this could be replaced by 
a more reliable and possibly submersible light source, perhaps LED-driven, could replace this in the future. The UV output of the lamp is quite good, approximately $\lambda=$ \SI{225}{\nano\meter}, which corresponds closely to the work function of gold (\SIrange{4.9}{5.1}{\eV}). 
%Several 
Three UV quartz fibers carry the xenon UV light into the cryostat to illuminate the %gold 
photocathode.   Another quartz fiber delivers the light into a properly biased photodiode outside the cryostat to provide the trigger signal when the lamp flashes.

%The xenon flash lamp and the \dword{fe} electronics are installed close to the purity monitor flange, to reduce light loss through the optical fiber and prevent signal loss.

The slow control system communicates with the purity monitor \dword{daq} software and controls  the \dword{hv} and \dword{lv} power supplies of the purity monitor system. The optical fiber must be very close to the photocathode (less than \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}) for efficient \phel extraction, so little interference with the \dword{pds} is expected. The purity monitors could induce noise in the TPC electronics, in particular from the current surge through the xenon lamps when they are flashed.  This source of noise can be controlled by placing the xenon flash lamp inside its own Faraday cage, which allows proper grounding and shielding. According to the operation of purity monitors at \dword{pdsp}, after careful checks of the grounding, this noise is well below noise generated by other sources.

%Andrew
%Individual purity monitors will be produced and they will be assembled into the string that will be placed into the \dword{detmodule} cryostat following the methodology developed for \dword{protodune}.  Each monitor is fabricated, assembled, and then tested in a smaller test stand.  After confirming that each purity monitor operates at the required level, all monitors are assembled into strings using support tubes that mount the system inside the cryostat with three purity monitors grouped together to form one string, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PrMon-SystemString}.

The \dword{cisc} consortium will produce the individual purity monitors, test them in a test stand, and confirm that each monitor operates at the required level before assembling them into strings of three monitors that will be mounted in the \dword{detmodule} cryostat using support tubes. The assembly process will follow the methodology developed for \dword{protodune}.

%The assembly of the individual purity monitors into the string would follow the steps laid out in the first 5 panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:PrMon-Assembly}.

Given the complexity and size of purity monitors, they can only be installed where there is sufficient space to provide a local measurement of
\lar purity. %While a direct measurement of the LAr purity across the entire cryostat is not viable, a sufficiently detailed \threed temperature map can predict LAr purity using \dword{cfd} simulations.

A direct measurement of the \lar purity across the entire cryostat is not feasible, but a sufficiently detailed \threed temperature map based on \dword{cfd} simulations can predict the purity. The vertical coordinate is especially important because it will relate closely to the

will be used for one of the T-gradient monitors based on a movable system that can be used to cross calibrate
the temperature sensors {\em in situ}, as described in Section \ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-dynamic-therm}.

The baseline designs for all thermometer systems have three elements in
common: sensors, cables, and readout system. We plan to use Lake Shore
PT100-series\footnote{Lake Shore Cryotronics\texttrademark{} platinum RTD series,
  \url{https://www.lakeshore.com/}.} %products/cryogenic-temperature-sensors/platinum-rtds/models/Pages/Overview.aspx}.} 
platinum sensors with \SI{100}{\ohm} resistance %are used 
because, in
the temperature range \SIrange{83}{92}{K}, %these particular sensors
they 
show high reproducibility of $\sim\SI{5}{mK}$ and absolute temperature
accuracy of \SI{100}{mK}.  Using a four-wire readout greatly reduces
issues with lead resistance, any parasitic resistances,
connections through the flange, and general electromagnetic noise
pick up. Lakeshore PT102 sensors (see
Figure~\ref{fig:sensor-support}-Right) were used in the \dword{35t} prototype
and \dword{pdsp}, % detector, 
giving excellent results. For the inner
readout cables, a custom cable made by Axon\footnote{Axon\texttrademark{} Cable, \url{http://www.axon-cable.com}.}
is the baseline. It
consists of four teflon-jacketed copper wires (AWG28), forming two
twisted pairs, with a metallic external shield and an outer teflon
jacket.
%Further details are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensor_cable}-Right. 
The readout system is described in Section \ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-therm-readout}.

%As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensor_cable}, the PT102 sensor has a length of \SI{21}{mm}, which can easily be accommodated in the \dword{dune} T-gradient monitors.

Another set of lower-precision sensors epoxied into the bottom membrane of the cryostat will monitor  cryostat filling in the initial stage.

%(behind the APAs for SP and behind the lateral FC end-walls for DP). 
%For the SP detector, since the electric potential is zero behind the APAs, no electric field shielding is required, simplifying enormously the mechanical design.
%\footnote{This does not apply for the DP detector, for which the proper shielding must be provided.} 
The baseline design assumes six arrays with \num{24} sensors each. 
Spacing between sensors
is \SI{40}{cm} at the top and bottom and \SI{80}{cm} in the middle area. As Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-cfd-valid} shows, a configuration with 24 sensors was appropriate in \dword{pdsp}, as it should be in the \dword{dpmod} where the expected total gradient is no larger than in \dword{pdsp} (see Figure~\ref{fig:cfd-example}). To mitigate the risk of sensor failures, installing two sensors at each position is under consideration.  

\begin{dunefigure}[Temperature sensor resolution and reproducibility]{fig:Trepro}{

\end{dunefigure}

Sensors will be cross-calibrated in the laboratory using a controlled environment and a high-precision readout system, described in Section \ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-therm-readout}.
%Although the calibration procedure will certainly improve, the one currently used for \dword{pdsp} is descrived here.
%Four sensors are placed as close as possible (such that identical temperature can be assumed for all of them) inside a small cylindrical aluminum capsule,
%which protects the sensors from thermal shocks and helps in minimizing convection.
%One of the sensors acts as reference while the other three are the ones being calibrated. Five independent calibrations
%are performed for each set of three sensors, such that the reproducibility of each sensor can be computed. For each calibration 
%the capsule is introduced in a PLA box of size \(9.5\times9.5\times\SI{19}{cm^3}\), with two concentrical independent volumes of LAr
%and sourounded by a polystyrene box with \SI{15}{cm} thick walls. A small quantity of LAr is used to slowly
%cooldown the capsule to $\sim\SI{90}{K}$, avoiding thermal shocks that could dammage the sensors.
%Then the capsule is covered by LAr such that it penetrates
%inside fully covering the sensors. Once the temperature stabilizes to the 1-\SI{2}{mK} level (after 5-15 minutes) measurements are taken. Then the capsule is taken out from LAr
%and kept at room temperature until it reaches \SI{200}{K}. As mentioned above, this procedure is repeated five times, before going to the next set of three sensors.  
The accuracy of the calibration for \dword{pdsp} was estimated to be $\SI{2.6}{mK}$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:Trepro}). Figure~\ref{fig:pd_static_t_results} shows the preliminary results of the analysis of \dword{pdsp} static T-gradient monitor data. The temperature profile was computed using both the laboratory calibration and the so-called \textit{in-situ pump-off calibration}, which consists %in 
of estimating the offsets between sensors assuming the temperature of \lar in the cryostat is homogeneous when the re-circulation pumps are off. (The validity of this method is demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-dynamic-therm}.)  
The \dword{rms} of the difference between both methods is $\SI{4.6}{mK}$, slightly more than the value quoted above for the accuracy of laboratory calibration, due to the presence of a few outliers (under investigation) and the imperfect assumption of homogeneous temperature when pumps are off (see Figure~\ref{fig:dynamic_t_pumps-off}).

Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-static-tgradient} shows the baseline mechanical design of
the static T-gradient monitor. Two vertical strings are anchored at the top and bottom corners of the cryostat
using the available M10 bolts (see Figure~\ref{fig:sensor-support}, left). One string routes the cables while the other,
separated from the first by \SI{150}{mm},  supports the temperature sensors and the individual Faraday cages. 
Given the height of the cryostat, an intermediate anchoring point might be needed to reduce swinging. To reduce the effect of shrinkage in the strings under cryogenic conditions and to guarantee that the same tension is always applied, springs will be made of materials with low coefficients of linear thermal expansion like carbon fiber or invar. A special spring could be also used. A prototype is being built at \dword{ific}, where the full system will be mounted using two dummy cryostat corners.  


Figure~\ref{fig:sensor-support}, right shows the baseline design of the ($52\times \SI{15}{mm^2}$) 
PCB support for temperature sensors with an IDC-4 male connector. %It is . 

A narrower connector (with two rows of two pins each) is being studied. This alternative design would reduce the width of the \dword{pcb} assembly and allow more sensors to be calibrated simultaneously. Each four-wire cable from the sensor to the flange will have an IDC-4 female connector on the sensor end; the flange end of the cable will be soldered or crimped to the appropriate connector, whose type and number of pins  depend on the final design of the \dword{dss} ports that will be used to extract the cables. SUBD-25 connectors were used in \dword{pdsp}.

\subsubsection{Dynamic T-gradient monitors}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-dynamic-therm}
% What I was thinking about is to have 3 sensors per meter. 4 would be even better and have 1.35 m range of motion. The goal is to have 4 sensor overlap. In this case, we would be quite safe against sensor failure.
% If we are to populate 14 m with 3 sensors per meter, that would be 42 sensors. In addition, we should increase frequency at the top or bottom.

%The dynamic temperature monitor is a vertical array of high precision temperature sensors to measure the vertical temperature gradient within a few mK. The design of the system is driven by the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%Uncertainties in the measured vertical temperature profile must be less than a few mK over the entire detector height to monitor LAr purity and provide useful feedback on the efficiency of cryogenic recirculation and purification.
%\item
%Simulations of cryogenic recirculation predict very slow changes in temperature at meter scale except at the bottom and top of the cryostat. Thus, sensors will be placed every \SI{50}{cm} along the detector height with more sensors in the first \SI{50}{cm}, closest to the bottom of the cryostat, and the last \SI{50}{cm}, closest to the top of the cryostat, where spacing between sensors is reduced to \SI{10}{cm}.
% \end{itemize}

% ANSELMO: Paragraph below removed, since it is substituted by the one by Jelena

%The dynamic T-gradient monitor is a vertical array of high precision temperature sensors to measure the vertical temperature gradient within a few mK. 
%To address concerns about potential differences in sensor readings before and after installation in the \dword{dune} \dword{fd}, the dynamic T-gradient monitor allows cross-calibration of sensors {\em in situ}. Namely, the system can move vertically while installed in the \dword{fd} such that a given sensor can be placed at the nominal position of its neighbor, and the temperature offset between them can be computed assuming the temperature at that location did not change during the movement. 

% \fixme{New paragraph from Jelena below. (2019-01-11)}

 Potential differences in sensor readings before and after sensors are installed in a \dword{detmodule} and potential drifts over the lifetime of the %detector 
 module may affect accuracy of the vertical temperature gradient measurement. Thus, to address these concerns, % in a \dword{detmodule}, 
 a dynamic temperature monitor can cross-calibrate  sensor readings %{\em in situ}. 
 \textit{in situ}.
This T-gradient monitor is motorized, allowing vertical movement of the temperature sensor array %in vertical direction while installed 
in the \dword{detmodule}, %. This ability enables 
enabling precise cross-calibration between the sensors %{\em in situ}
\textit{in situ}, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sensor-cross-calibration}.  

Cross-calibrations requires several steps. In step 1, the temperature reading  of all sensors is taken at the home (lowest) position of the carrier rod. In  step 2, the stepper motor moves the carrier rod up \SI{25}{cm}. The sensors along the entire  carrier rod are positioned \SI{25}{cm} apart, so when the system moves up \SI{25}{cm}, each sensor is positioned at the height occupied by another sensor in step 1. Then a second temperature reading is taken. Other than the lowest position, this means two temperature measurements are taken at each location with %two 
different sensors. Assuming that the temperature at each location is stable over the few minutes required to make the measurements, %the 
any differences in the temperature readings between the two different sensors would be due to their relative measurement offset. This %temperature readings 
difference is then calculated for all locations.  In step 3, readout differences between pairs of sensors at each location are linked to one another, so each sensor measures the temperature at all heights. In this way, temperature readings from all sensors are cross-calibrated %{\em in situ}
\textit{in situ}, canceling all possible offsets due to electromagnetic noise or any parasitic resistances that may occur despite the four-point connection to the sensors that should cancel most offsets. These measurements are taken with a very stable current source, which ensures high precision of repeated temperature measurements over time. The dynamic T-monitor operates with a stepper-motor, so measurements are delivered with high spatial resolution. 

\begin{dunefigure}[Principle of cross-calibration with dynamic T-gradient monitor]{fig:sensor-cross-calibration}
  {In step 1, sensor temperature measurements are taken with the T-gradient monitor in the home position. In step 2, the entire system is moved up \SI{25}{cm}, and another set of temperature readings is taken by all sensors. Then, the offsets between pairs of sensors are calculated for each position. In step 3, offsets are linked together, providing cross-calibration of all sensors, to obtain the entire vertical temperature gradient measurement for a single sensor (number 1 in this case). }
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{cisc_cross_calibration_illustration.png}%
\end{dunefigure}


A total of \num{72} sensors will be installed and spaced \SI{25}{cm} apart, although at the top and bottom \SI{1}{m} of the carrier rod, sensor spacing is decreased to \SI{10}{cm}.  
 With the vertical displacement of the system, every sensor can be moved to the nominal position of at least five other sensors, minimizing any risks associated with sensor failure and providing several points of comparison. The total expected motion range of the carrier rod is \SI{1.35}{m}.

%\fixme{This entire procedure is unclear. Shorten the sentences and make the procedure description more precise. A figure might help, along with references to that figure in the text. {\bf  ANSELMO:  I've removed the existing text and added some text above. The concept is clear, I don't think we need to give more details, which could confuse the reader.} {\em I think it is clear now. =Glenn}} 

%The procedure for cross-calibration involves first, taking a temperature reading at the lowest sensor position. Then, the stepper motor moves the carrier rod up by \SI{50}{cm} putting all sensors in the location of their neighbor that is \SI{50}{cm} above them. Then the second reading is taken. In this manner, except for the lowest position we have temperature measurement at each location with two adjacent sensors, and by linking the temperature offsets between the two readings at each location, temperature readings from all sensors are cross-calibrated {\em in situ}, canceling all offsets due to electromagnetic noise or any parasitic resistances that may have prevailed despite the four point connection to the sensors that should cancel most of the offsets. These measurements are taken with very stable current source, which ensures high precision of repeated temperature measurements over time. The motion of the dynamic T-monitor is stepper motor operated, delivering measurements with high spatial resolution. 

This procedure was tested in \dword{pdsp}, where the system was successfully moved up by a maximum of \SI{51}{cm}, allowing cross-calibration of all sensors (22 sensors with \SI{10.2}{cm} spacing at top and bottom and \SI{51}{cm} in the middle). 
Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-cfd-valid} shows the temperature profile after calibration; the smoothness of the profile demonstrates the reliability of the method. An even better figure of merit is %however 
the temperature profile after cross-calibration, when the recirculation pumps are off. Under these conditions, the  temperature should be homogeneous except near the surface. This is indeed what %is observed in 
Figure~\ref{fig:dynamic_t_pumps-off} shows.

%\subsubsection{Dynamic T-gradient monitor design}
%\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-dynamic-therm-design}
A dynamic T-gradient monitor has three parts: a carrier rod on which sensors are mounted; an enclosure above the cryostat housing space that allows the carrier rod to move vertically  \SI{1.5}{m} over its lowest location; and the motion mechanism. The motion mechanism is a stepper motor connected through a ferrofluidic dynamic seal to a gear and pinion motion mechanism. The sensors have two pins soldered to a \dword{pcb}. 
%\fixme{maybe add gloss term}
Two wires are individually soldered to the common soldering pad for each pin.  A cutout in the \dword{pcb} around the sensor allows free flow of argon for more accurate temperature readings.  Stepper motors typically have very fine steps that allow highly precise positioning of the sensors.  Figure~\ref{fig:fd-slow-cryo-dt-monitor-overview} shows the overall design of the dynamic T-gradient monitor. % with the sensor carrier rod, enclosure above the cryostat, and stepper motor mounted on the side of the enclosure. 
The enclosure has two parts connected by a six-cross flange. One side of this flange will be used for signal wires, another will be used as a viewing window, and the two other ports will be spares. Figure~\ref{fig:fd-slow-cryo-sensor-mount}, left, shows the \dword{pcb} mounted on the carrier rod and the sensor mounted on the \dword{pcb} along with the four point connection to the signal readout wires. %Finally, 
Figure~\ref{fig:fd-slow-cryo-sensor-mount}, right, shows the stepper motor mounted on the side of the rod enclosure. The motor remains outside the enclosure, at room temperature, %and 
as do its power and control cables. % also remain outside.

\subsubsection{Individual Temperature Sensors}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-individual-therm}

T-gradient monitors will be complemented by a coarser 2D array (every \SI{5}{m}) of precision sensors at the bottom of the \dword{detmodule}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-dp-tsensor-map}. These sensors could  use the cryogenic pipes as a support structure following the \dword{pdsp} design. An alternative design using the support structure for \dword{pd}s is also under consideration.  

As in \dword{pdsp}, another set of standard sensors will be evenly distributed and epoxied to the bottom membrane. They will detect the presence of \lar when cryostat filling starts. Finally, two vertical arrays of standard sensors will be epoxied to the lateral walls in two opposite vertical corners, spaced \SI{102}{cm} apart (every three corrugations), to monitor the cryostat membrane temperature during cooldown and filling. 

%While 
Whereas in \dword{pdsp}, cables were routed individually (without touching neighboring cables or any metallic elements) to prevent grounding loops in case the outer Teflon jacket broke, such a failure is very unlikely. Thus, in the \dwords{detmodule}, cables will be routed in bundles, simplifying the design enormously. 
%As Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-dp-tsensor-map} shows, up to 20 sensors will use the same \dword{dss} port, large enough for a cable bundle \SI{16}{mm} in diameter.
Cable bundles of several sizes will be configured using custom made Teflon 
pieces %,  %(see Fig.~\ref{fig:cable-support})
%which 
that will be anchored to different cryostat and detector elements to route cables from sensors to the assigned cryostat ports. For sensors at the bottom (on pipes/\dword{pd}s and floor), cables will be routed towards the bottom horizontal corner of the cryostat using stainless steel split clamps anchored to pipes (successfully prototyped in \dword{pdsp}) and from there, to the top of the cryostat using vertical strings (as with static T-gradient monitors). 
%For sensors on the top \dwords{gp}, cables bundles will be routed to the corresponding \dword{dss} port using Teflon supports attached to both the FR4 threaded rods in the union between two \dword{gp} modules and to the \dword{dss} I-beams (both successfully prototyped in \dword{pdsp}). 
Sensors on the walls will use bolts in the vertical corners for cable routing. 

For all individual sensors, \dword{pcb} sensor support, cables, and connection to the flanges will be the same as for the T-gradient monitors.

\subsubsection{Vertical arrays in gas phase}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-static-therm-gass}

The temperature map in the gas is specially important for the dual phase technology. 
As in \dword{pddp}, the region immediately above (about 40 cm) the \dword{crp}s will be instrumented with vertical arrays of temperature sensors.  The baseline design foresees for each of these arrays 8 standard \dword{rtd}s with increasing pitch with height above the \dword{crp}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-tsensor-gas} for the device installed in \dword{pddp}. Twenty (20) of these arrays would be distributed throughout the top of the cryostat. Unlike the liquid, where the temperature gradient is not larger than 10 mK, the temperature in the gas changes very rapidly with height, and a relative precision of 0.1 K is sufficient for those sensors. Thus, standard \dword{rtd}s with calibration can be used.

\subsubsection{Readout system for thermometers}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-therm-readout}

A %highly precise 
high-precision and very stable system is required to achieve a readout level of $<\,\SI{5}{mK}$.
The proposed readout system was used in \dword{pdsp} and relies on a variant of an existing mass PT100 temperature readout system developed at
\dword{cern} for an LHC \fixme{LHC is not defined in either the common glossary or in the glossary for this document. Does it need to be defined? If not, should it be spelled out?. CP: I think the definition of LHC is not needed, it is commonly understood} experiment; it has already been tested and validated by the collaboration experts. The system has an electronic circuit that includes
\begin{itemize}
\item a precise and accurate current source for exciting the temperature sensors measured using the four-wires method;
\item a multiplexing circuit connecting the temperature sensor signals and forwarding the selected signal to a single line; and 
\item a readout system  with a high-accuracy voltage signal readout module\footnote{National Instrument CompactRIO\texttrademark{} device  with a signal readout NI9238\texttrademark{} module} with 24 bit resolution over a \SI{1}{V} range.
\end{itemize}
This readout system also drives the multiplexing circuit and calculates temperature values. The CompactRIO device is connected to the detector Ethernet network, sending temperature values to the \dword{dcs} software through a standard \dword{opc-ua} driver.
%\fixme{These acronyms are not defined- RIO, DCS, OPC, UA. GLENN AND CARMEN TO CHECK}

The current mode of operation averages more than \num{2000} samples taken every second for each sensor. 
Figure~\ref{fig:Trepro} shows the system has a resolution higher than 
\SI{1}{mK}, the \dword{rms} of one of the offsets in the stable region.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LIQUID LEVEL MONITORING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Liquid Level Monitoring}
% john L, anselmo
% SP

%\fixme{SG/ACV: Done. To be checked !!!!}

The \lar level monitoring system has two goals: basic level sensing when filling and precise level sensing during stable operations. The system also provides information for safety interlocks (e.g. \dword{hv}). \dword{dune} will use both differential pressure level meters (\dword{lbnf} scope) and capacitive level meters (\dword{dune} scope). Liquid level meters provide useful information for both cryostat filling and stable operation. Dedicated level meters will be complemented by vertical arrays of temperature sensors (see Section~\ref{sec:fddp-cryo-therm}), located at known heights and used to determine the \lar level (they will change temperature dramatically when the cold liquid reaches each of them), and by cameras, which will focus on the \lar surface at all times.  

Filling the cryostat with \lar will take several months. During this operation, several systems will monitor the \lar level. 
The first 5.5 m of \dword{lar} will be monitored by cameras and by the vertical arrays of \dwords{rtd}s. Once the liquid reaches the level of the cryogenic pipes going out of the cryostat, 
the differential pressure between that point and the bottom of the cryostat
can be converted to depth using
the known density of \lar.  Fine tuning the final \lar level require several capacitive level meters at the top of the cryostat; this system comprises several 4~m long capacitive level sensors (with a precision of less than 5~mm) which will be checked against each other. One capacitive level sensor at each of the four corners of the cryostat will provide sufficient redundancy to ensure that no single point of failure compromises the %capacitive level sensor 
measurement.

%Although differential pressure between the top of the cryostat and known points below can be converted to depth using the known density of \lar, this technique can only be used when the top pressure sensor is reached. 

%\todo{ACV: ask David about the problem in using differential pressure level meters for filling} During this period, the differential pressure between the top of the cryostat and known points below can be converted to depth using
%the known density of \lar.  
%\fixme{CP: Sentence below to be replaced by CRP high resolution LM. SG: Out of CISC scope; but I added a couple of sentences to say this.} 
%Fine tuning of the final \lar level will be done using 
%multiple capacitive level meters located at the top of the cryostat. 

During operations, liquid level monitoring has two purposes:
monitoring to tune the \lar flow, and monitoring for safety interlocking purposes and for cross checks. 
%the \dword{lbnf} cryogenics system uses monitoring to tune the \lar flow, and \dword{dune} uses monitoring for safety interlocking purposes and for cross checks. 
%DUNE uses monitoring to guarantee that the top \dwords{gp} are always submerged %(otherwise, the risk of dielectric breakdown is high). The plan is to keep the \lar surface at least \SI{20}{cm} above
%the \dwords{gp}. 
%at least \SI{20}{cm} below the \lar surface to mitigate the risk of dielectric breakdown. This was the value used for the \dword{hv} interlock in \dword{pdsp}. 

The \lar flow is tuned using two differential pressure level meters, installed as part of the cryogenics system, one on each side of the \dword{detmodule}.  They have a precision of \SI{0.1}{\%}, which corresponds to \SI{14}{mm} at the nominal \lar surface. Cryogenic pressure sensors will be purchased from commercial sources. Installation methods and positions will be determined as part of the cryogenics internal piping plan. 
The dual phase technology must control the \lar surface at the sub-millimeter level, so fine tuning the \lar level will require two high precision capacitive level meters attached to the inner cryostat membrane at the appropriate height.   

%Sufficient redundancy will be designed in
%to ensure that no single point of failure compromises the level measurement.

%This precision is sufficient for the  \dword{spmod}, since the plan is to keep the \lar surface at least \SI{20}{cm} above the \dwords{gp} (this is the value used for the \dword{hv}
%interlock in \dword{pdsp}); thus, no additional level meters are required for the \single. 
%\fixme{CP: Paragraph below to be reviewed}
For %\dword{hv} integrity
safety interlocking and to cross check measurements with differential pressure level meters the long capacitive level meters will be used. 

% However, in the \dual \lar system the surface level should be controlled at the millimeter level, which can be accomplished with capacitive monitors. Using the same capacitive monitor system in each \dword{detmodule} reduces design differences and provides a redundant system for the \single.  Either system could be used for the \dword{hv} interlock.

In addition to these level meters, the \dword{crp} will use high precision (less than 1~mm) capacitive level meters attached to the \dword{crp} frame to monitor constant \dword{crp} alignment to the liquid surface. These fall under the scope of the \dword{crp} consortium and are described in Chapter~\ref{ch:dp-crp} of this \dword{tdr} volume.

Figure~\ref{fig:cisc_pdsp_level} shows the evolution of the \dword{pdsp} \dword{lar} level over two months as measured by the differential pressure and capacitive level meters. 
%\fixme{Liquid Level Monitoring has \dword{protodune} results --> \textbf{Anselmo to get data, add something about this. WORK IN PROGRESS}}

\begin{dunefigure}[\lar level measurements]{fig:cisc_pdsp_level}{Evolution of the \dword{pdsp} \lar level over two months. Left: Measured by the capacitive level meter.

\end{dunefigure}

\dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp} use the same design for differential pressure level meters and will also be used in the far detector \dword{sp} and \dword{dp} modules. For the capacitive level meters, \dword{pdsp} is using commercial 1.5~m long level meters while \dword{pddp} is using 4~m long level meters custom-built by \dword{cern}. For the \dword{dune} \dword{fd}, we plan to use the longer capacitive level meters custom-built by \dword{cern} for both \dword{sp} and \dword{dp} modules.



\subsection{Pressure Meters}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-press-meter}

%\fixme{SG/ACV:Done. New section for DP only}

Measuring the pressure of argon gas in the DUNE \dword{fd} is important because it can affect gas density, and consequently, the \dword{lem} gain calibration. The accuracy of the pressure sensors should be within at least 0.1\% or more of the real value. %The pressure needs to be monitored to 1~mbar precision and accuracy. 
Moreover, the absolute temperature in the liquid varies with the pressure in the argon gas, so precise measurements of pressure inside the cryostat provides a better picture of temperature gradients and \dword{cfd} simulations. In \dword{protodune}, pressure values were also used to understand the strain gauge signals installed in the cryostat frame.

Standard industrial pressure sensors can be used for this. For the \dword{dune} \dword{fd}, the plan is to follow the same design and configuration used in \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp}. \dword{protodune} uses two types of pressure sensors and a pressure switch as described below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A relative pressure sensor (range: 0-400~mbar, precision: 0.01~mbar),
    \item An absolute pressure sensor (range: 0-1600~mbar, precision: 0.05~mbar),
    \item A mechanical relative pressure switch adjustable from 50 to 250~mbar. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{dunefigure}[Photo of the pressure sensors installed on a flange in ProtoDUNE-SP]{fig:pdsp-pressure}
  {Photograph of the pressure sensors installed on a flange in \dword{pdsp}.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/cisc-pdsp-pressure-meters}
\end{dunefigure}

Both sensors and the pressure switch are installed in a dedicated flange as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pdsp-pressure} and are connected directly to a slow controls system \dword{plc} circuit. Dedicated analogue inputs are used to read the current values (4 to 20~mA), which are then converted to pressure according to sensor range. Given the much larger size of \dword{dune} \dword{fd}, this system will be doubled for redundancy: two flanges in opposite cryostat sides will be instrumented with three sensors each. 

%\fixme{ACV: I think the system under DUNE scope should be doubled. See sentence above}

Further, relative and absolute pressure sensors (with comparatively lower precision) are installed by \dword{lbnf} that are also recorded by the slow controls system. The availability of two types of sensors from \dword{lbnf} and \dword{cisc} provides redundancy, independent measurements, and cross checks.
%This redundancy with \dword{lbnf} on both absolute and relative pressure sensors is considered important so small (mbar-level) variations in pressure can be detected. \todo{ACV: I don't understand this statement, why the redundancy allows to detect small variations ? }

%Xavier suggests not to mention the below
%The pressure sensors used by \dword{pddp} are safety integrity level 2 (SIL~2) standard according to the International Safety Standard IEC61508/IEC61511 allowing one to interface them to a dedicated safety system. This is an important  feature especially during the commissioning period.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GAS ANALYZERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Gas Analyzers}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-gas-anlyz}
% alan h
%\fixme{CP: Valid Section; Alan checked and made small edits}
 Gas analyzers are commercially produced modules that measure trace quantities of specific gases contained within a stream of carrier gas. The carrier gas for \dword{dune} is argon, and the trace gases of interest are oxygen ($\text{O}_2$), water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and nitrogen ($\text{N}_2$). $\text{O}_2$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ affect the electron lifetime in \dword{lar} and must be kept below \SI{0.1}{ppb} ($\text{O}_2$ equivalent) while $\text{N}_2$ affects the efficiency of scintillation light production at levels higher than \SI{1}{ppm}.
The argon is sampled from either the argon vapor in the ullage or from the \dword{lar} by using small diameter tubing run from the sampling point to the gas analyzer. Typically, the tubing from the sampling points are connected to a switchyard valve assembly used to route the sample points to the desired gas analyzers (see Figure~\ref{fig:GA-switchyard}).


\begin{dunefigure}[Photo of a gas analyzer switchyard valve assembly]{fig:GA-switchyard}
  {A gas analyzer switchyard that routes sample points to the different gas analyzers.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{cisc_GasAnalyzerSwitchyard.png}
\end{dunefigure}

%The following lists three times 
The gas analyzer would be predominantly used during three periods: \fixme{This introductory statement mentions three periods, but four are listed. Either the three should be changed to four or one of the following items is out of place. I suspect the last item, number 4, is out of place because that is not a period but an explanation. Number 4 can be switched out of the list and included in the text. It may be that number 4 should be included in the paragraph beginning (in the PDF file) on page 36, line 18. (Because any one gas analyzer covers only one contaminant species...). CP: I agree, done}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Once the detector is installed and after the air atmosphere is eliminated from the cryostat to levels low enough to begin cooldown. This purge and gas recirculation process is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-ga}. Figure~\ref{fig:cisc_Phase1_purge_gas_recirculation} shows the evolution of the $\text{N}_2$, $\text{O}_2$, and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ levels from gas analyzer data taken during the purge and recirculation stages of the \dword{dune} \dword{35t} %Prototype P
phase 1 run.

%\item Track trace $\text{O}_2$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ contaminants from $\>$tens of ppb to hundreds of ppt. This is useful when other means of monitoring impurity levels (e.g., purity monitors, or \dshort{tpc} tracks) are not yet sensitive. Figure~\ref{fig:cisc_O2AnalyzerPrM2_HVRun1} shows a example plot of $\text{O}_2$ levels at the beginning of \dword{lar} purification from one of the later \num{35}\si{t} %Prototype \dword{hv} runs.
\item Before other means of monitoring impurity levels (e.g., purity monitors or \dshort{tpc} tracks) are sensitive, to track trace $\text{O}_2$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ contaminants from $\>$tens of ppb to hundreds of ppt.  Figure~\ref{fig:cisc_O2AnalyzerPrM2_HVRun1} shows an example plot of $\text{O}_2$ levels at the beginning of \lar purification from one of the later \dword{35t} \dword{hv} runs.

\item During cryostat filling to monitor the tanker \lar delivery purity. This tracks the impurity load on the filtration system and rejects any deliveries that do not meet specifications. Likely specifications for delivered \lar are in the \SI{10}{ppm} range per contaminant.

%\item Because the filling and commissioning of different cryostats will occur at different times, sharing the same gas analyzer installation between them should be possible with minimal effect on the operation on other cryostats. The gas analyzer switchyard can easily switch between cryostat source lines.

Note that the purity monitor is sensitive to both $\text{O}_2$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ impurities giving rise to its higher levels of impurity.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{cisc_O2AnalyzerPrM2_HVRun1.png}
\end{dunefigure}

Because the filling and commissioning of different cryostats will occur at different times, sharing the same gas analyzer installation between them should be possible with minimal effect on the operation on other cryostats. The gas analyzer switchyard can easily switch between cryostat source lines.
%Because 
Since any one gas analyzer covers only one contaminant species and a range of \numrange{3}{4} orders of magnitude, several units are needed both for the three contaminant gases and to cover the ranges seen between cryostat closure and the beginning of \dshort{tpc} operations:
\SI{20}{\percent} to $\lesssim 100$~ppt for $\text{O}_2$,
\SI{80}{\percent} to $\lesssim 1$~ppm for $\text{N}_2$, and
$\sim \SI{1}{\percent}$ to $\lesssim 1$~ppb for $\text{H}_2\text{O}$.
Because the total cost of these analyzers exceeds $\SI{100}[\mathdollar]{k}$, we want to be able to  sample more than a single location or cryostat with the same gas analyzer. At the same time, the tubing run lengths from the sample point should be as short as possible to maintain a timely response for the gas analyzer. This puts some constraints on sharing devices because, for example, argon is delivered at the surface, so a separate gas analyzer may be required there. %at the surface.

% \fixme{Do Gas Analyzers have \dword{protodune} design and results? Alan and Stephen say they weren't used as extensively at PDSP as at 35t, and "35t is also a prototype and has shown how gas analyzers can be used."}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%55 CAMERAS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
\subsection{Cameras}
% glenn, jim s, chuck
% ALMOST same text in single and dual phase

Cameras provide direct visual information about the state of the
\dword{detmodule} during critical operations and when damage or unusual
conditions are suspected.  Cameras in the \dword{wa105} showed spray from cooldown
nozzles and the level and state of the \lar as it covered the \dword{crp} \cite{Murphy:20170516}.  A camera was
used in the Liquid Argon Purity Demonstrator
cryostat\cite{Adamowski:2014daa} to study \dword{hv} discharges in
\lar and in EXO-100 while a \dword{tpc} was operating
\cite{Delaquis:2013hva}.  Warm cameras viewing \lar from a distance
have been used to observe \dword{hv} discharges in \lar in
fine detail \cite{Auger:2015xlo}.  Cameras are commonly used during
calibration source deployment in many experiments (e.g., the
\kamland ultra-clean system \cite{Banks:2014hra}).

In \dword{dune}, cameras will verify the stability, straightness,
and alignment of the hanging \dword{tpc} structures during cooldown and
filling; ensure that no bubbling occurs near the \dwords{gp}
(\single) or \dwords{crp} (\dual); inspect the
state of movable parts in the \dword{detmodule} (calibration devices, dynamic
thermometers); and closely inspect parts of the \dword{tpc} after any seismic activity or other unanticipated
event.  For these functions, a set of fixed
cold cameras are used; they are permanently mounted at fixed points in the cryostat
for use during filling and commissioning. A movable, replaceable
warm inspection camera can be deployed through any free
instrumentation flange at any time during the life of the
experiment. 
% [GAHS: I commented out the table.] Table \ref{tab:fdgen-cameras-req} summarizes the requirements for the camera system.

\fixme{GAHS: Update paragraph below for DP 2nd draft once more is known.}
As this is written, the \dword{pddp} installation is nearing completion, and no validation of camera operation in \dword{pddp} is yet available. However,
eleven cameras were deployed in \dword{pdsp}.
They successfully provided views of the detector during filling and throughout
its operation. The camera designs used in \dword{protodune} will be the basis for the final camera designs used in the \dword{dpmod}.

\subsubsection{Cryogenic Cameras (Cold)}

The fixed cameras
monitor the following items during filling:
\begin{itemize}
\item positions of corners of \dwords{crp}, cathode, \dwords{fc}, \dwords{gp} (\SI{1}{mm} resolution),
\item relative straightness and alignment of \dwords{crp}, cathode, and \dwords{fc} (\(<\sim\SI{1}{mm}\)),
\item relative positions of \dword{fc} profiles and resistive sheaths between super-modules (\SI{0.5}{mm} resolution), and 
\item the \lar surface, specifically, the presence of bubbling or debris.
\end{itemize}


% GAHS: I commented out the (pre-\dword{protodune}) past performance discussion because the PDSP cameras performed so well.
% There are published articles and unpublished presentations describing
% completely or partially successful operation of low-cost,
% off-the-shelf \dword{cmos} cameras in custom enclosures immersed in cryogens.
% (e.g., EXO-100: \cite{Delaquis:2013hva}; \dword{dune} \dword{35t} test
% \cite{McConkey:2016spe}; \dword{wa105}: \cite{Murphy:20170516}.)  Generally
% it is reported that such cameras show poor performance and ultimately
% fail to function below some temperature of order \SIrange{150}{200}{K}, but some report that their cameras recover fully after
% being stored (not operated) at temperatures as low as \SI{77}{K} and
% then brought up to minimum operating temperature.

% However, as with photon sensors, experience has also shown that it is
% non-trivial to ensure reliable and reproducible mechanical and
% electrical integrity of such cameras in the cryogenic environment 
% (e.g., \cite{McConkey:2016spe} and
% \cite{Valencia-Rodriquez:20180130}).  Off-the-shelf cameras and camera
% components are generally only specified by the vendors and original
% manufacturers for operation down to \SI{-40}{\celsius} or \SI{-50}{\celsius}.
% In addition, many low-cost cameras use digital interfaces not intended
% for long distance deployment, such as USB (\(2\sim\SI{5}{m}\)) or CSI (circuit
% board scale), leading to signal degradation and noise problems.

One design for the \dword{dune} fixed cameras uses an enclosure similar to
the successful EXO-100 design \cite{Delaquis:2013hva}, which was also
used successfully in the Liquid Argon Purity Demonstrator
and \dword{pdsp} (see Figure~\ref{fig:gen-fdgen-cameras-enclosure}).
%%% COMMENT OUT FOR DP -GAHS
% Cameras 101, 102, 104, and 105, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pdsp-camera-locations}, use this enclosure.
A thermocouple in the enclosure allows temperature monitoring and a heating element provides temperature control.  
SUB-D \fixme{I'm going to assume SUB-D is commonly understood in the field. If not, it should be defined in the glossary.} connectors are used at the cryostat flanges and the camera enclosure for signal, power, and control connections.
% The enclosure is connected to a stainless steel gas line to allow it to be flushed with argon gas at low enough pressure to prevent liquification, using the same design as the gas line for the beam plug tested in the \dword{35t} \dword{hv} test and in \dword{protodune}.  
%The camera transmits its video signal using either a composite video signal over shielded coax or Ethernet over optical fiber.  Most importantly, the \dword{dune} \dword{cisc} consortium must work with vendors to design camera circuit boards that are robust and reliable in the cryogenic environment.

An alternative design uses an acrylic enclosure.
This design was used successfully in \dword{pdsp} (see Figure~\ref{fig:gen-fdgen-cameras-enclosure}, bottom left).
%%% COMMENT OUT FOR DP -Glenn
% Cameras 001, 002, 004, and 005, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pdsp-camera-locations}, use acrylic enclosures. 
All operate successfully, including those at the bottom of the cryostat.  Please note that the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} will be twice as deep as \dword{protodune}, and therefore cameras observing the lowest surfaces of the \dword{fc} must withstand twice the pressure.

We will continue prototyping and testing to finalize and validate the cold camera design for \dword{dune}, focusing particularly on pressure resistance.

\subsubsection{Inspection Cameras (Warm)}

The inspection cameras are intended to be as versatile as possible.
However, the following %locations 
inspections have been identified as likely uses:
%to be of interest:
\begin{itemize}
\item status of \dword{hv} \fdth and cup,
\item status and relative position of \dword{fc} profiles, resistive sheaths between \dword{fc} super-modules (\SI{0.5}{mm} resolution),
\item vertical deployment of calibration sources,
\item status of thermometers, especially dynamic thermometers,
\item \dword{hv} discharge, corona, or streamers on \dword{hv} \fdth, cup, or \dword{fc},
\item relative straightness and alignment of \dwords{crp}, cathode, and \dword{fc} (\SI{1}{mm} resolution), and
\item gaps between \dword{crp} frames (\SI{1}{mm} resolution).
\end{itemize}

Unlike the fixed cameras, the inspection cameras operate only as
long as any inspection; the cameras can be replaced in case of failure.  It
is also more practical to keep the cameras continuously warmer than
 \SI{-150}{\celsius} during deployment; this permits using  %and therefore we willhave 
commercial cameras. %more easily, e.g., %.  For example, we could deploy 
For example, cameras of the same model were used successfully to observe discharges
in \lar from \SI{120}{cm} away \cite{Auger:2015xlo}.


\begin{dunefigure}[Inspection camera design]{fig:gen-fdgen-cameras-movable}
  {Left: An overview of the inspection camera design using a sealed deployment system opening directly into the cryostat. Right: A photograph of the \dword{pdsp} warm inspection camera acrylic tube immediately before installation; the acrylic tube is sealed with an acrylic dome at the bottom and can be opened at the top.}
  \includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{Camera-Sketch}%
  \includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{cisc-pdsp-camera-tube}%
\end{dunefigure}

The inspection cameras use the same basic
enclosure design as cold cameras, but the cameras are mounted on a movable
fork, so each camera can be inserted and removed from the cryostat
using a design similar to the dynamic temperature probes (see
 figures~\ref{fig:gen-fdgen-cameras-movable} (left) and
 ~\ref{fig:fd-slow-cryo-sensor-mount}).  To avoid contaminating the
\lar with air, the entire system is sealed, and the
camera can only be deployed through a \fdth equipped with a gate
valve and a purging system, similar to the one used in the vertical axis
calibration system at \kamland~\cite{Banks:2014hra}. The entire system
is  purged with pure argon gas before the gate valve is opened.

Motors above the flange allow the fork to be rotated and moved vertically to position the camera. 
 A chain drive system with a motor
mounted on the end of the fork allows the camera assembly to tilt, 
creating a point-tilt mount that can be moved vertically.
With the space above the cryostat flanges and the
thickness of the cryostat insulation, cameras can be moved vertically up to
\SI{1}{m} inside the cryostat.
% In the event that it
% becomes necessary to deploy a camera more deeply, we would have the
% option of building a a cable deployment system or a multi-pole
% deployment system similar to the KamLAND full-volume calibration
% system\cite{Busenitz:2009ac}, but this is not currently part of the
% baseline design.
The motors for rotation and vertical motion are outside the sealed
volume, coupled mechanically using ferrofluidic seals, thus reducing any risk of
contamination and allowing manual rotation of the vertical
drive if the motor fails.  

An alternative design was demonstrated in \dword{pdsp}. In this design, the warm camera is contained inside a gas-tight acrylic tube inserted into the feedthrough, so a gate valve or a gas-tight rotatable stage is not needed; the warm cameras can thus be removed for servicing or upgrade at any time. Figure~\ref{fig:gen-fdgen-cameras-movable} (right) shows an acrylic tube enclosure and camera immediately before deployment.
Three such tubes were installed in \dword{pdsp}, and cameras with fisheye lenses were operated successfully.  One camera was removed without any evidence of contamination of the \dword{lar}.

We will continue prototyping and testing to finalize and validate the inspection camera design for \dword{dune}, focusing particularly on longevity, the ability to replace the camera, and protecting the \dword{lar}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Light-emitting system}
%%% same text as dual-phase
The light-emitting system uses \dwords{led} to illuminate
the parts of the %\dword{fd} 
\dword{detmodule} in the camera's field of view with selected
wavelengths (IR and visible) that cameras can detect.  Performance criteria for the light-emission system include the efficiency with which the cameras can detect the light and the need to avoid
adding heat to the cryostat. Very high-efficiency
\dwords{led}   
help reduce heat generation; one \SI{750}{nm} \dword{led} \cite{lumileds-DS144-pdf}
has a specification equivalent to
\SI{33}{\%} conversion of electrical input power to light.
% CEL: 1W electrical gives 425mW blue flux, power limit from SMD package thermal resistance of 8C/W to have max 1C increase at LED. CREE Xlamp XP-E model

While data on how well \dwords{led} perform at cryogenic temperatures
is sparse, some studies of NASA projects~\cite{Carron:2017zzz}
indicate that \dword{led} are more efficient at low temperatures and
that emitted wavelengths may change, particularly for blue
\dwords{led}.  In \dword{pdsp}, amber \dwords{led} were observed  to
emit green light at \dword{lar} temperature (see bottom right photo
in \ref{fig:gen-fdgen-cameras-enclosure}).  To avoid degradation of
wavelength-shifting materials in the \dword{pds}, short wavelength
\dwords{led} are not used in the \dword{fd}.

\begin{dunefigure}[Example schematic for LED chain]{fig:cisc-LED}
  {Example schematic for LED chain, allowing failure tolerance and two LED illumination spectra.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{cisc_led.png}
\end{dunefigure}

\dwords{led} are placed in a ring around the outside of each
camera, pointing in the same direction as the lens, to 
illuminate nearby parts of the \dword{detmodule} within the camera's field of
view. Commercially available \dwords{led} exist with
a range of angular spreads that can match the needs of the
cameras without additional optics.

Additionally, chains of \dwords{led} connected in series and driven with a
constant-current circuit are used for broad illumination, with each
\dword{led} paired in parallel with an opposite polarity \dword{led} and a resistor
(see Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-LED}).
This gives two different wavelengths of illumination using a single chain simply by changing the direction of the drive current and allows continued use of an \dword{led} chain even if individual \dwords{led} fail.

%\fixme{SG/ACV:DONE; New section added for DP}

Design validation and testing of many planned \dword{cisc} systems for the \dword{dune} \dword{dp} \dword{fd} will be done using data from both \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp} detectors as discussed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Level Meters:} The same differential pressure level meters that are already validated in \dword{pdsp} will be used in \dword{dp} \dword{fd}. The same capacitive level meters currently used in \dword{pddp} will be used in the \dword{dp} \dword{fd}. These will be validated in the upcoming \dword{pddp} run. 
    \item {\bf Pressure Meters (GAr):} The same high precision pressure sensors which are already validated in \dword{pdsp} will be used in \dword{dp} \dword{fd}.
    \item {\bf Gas Analyzers:} The same gas analyzers currently used in \dword{pdsp} will be used in \dword{dp} \dword{fd}. They have already been validated.
    \item {\bf Vertical array of thermometers in GAr:} The same design of vertical array of thermometers currently used in \dword{pddp} will be used in \dword{dp} \dword{fd} but with different distribution density. This design will be validated with \dword{pddp} data.
    \item {\bf High precision thermometer arrays in \lar:} The static and dynamic T-gradient thermometers discussed in previous sections are not yet installed in \dword{pddp}, but the plan is to deploy them in the \dword{dp} \dword{fd}. Therefore, the validation of these devices will be performed using \dword{pdsp} data and can also be tested in future running of \dword{pddp}.
    \item {\bf Purity monitors:} The purity monitors are being validated at both \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp}. Currently, \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp} are using slightly different designs. For the \dword{dp} \dword{fd}, the plan is to use the same design as \dword{pdsp} along with some improvements such as longer drift purity monitors to increase the range of measured lifetime values. The \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp} run 2 phase provides opportunities to test improved designs.  
    %\todo{CP:ProtoDUNE-DP is already testing possible improvements, as different silver cathodes}
    \item {\bf Cameras:} The various cameras are actively developed in both \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp}, so the designs will be validated at both the \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp}. Future improvements can be tested in \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp} run 2 phase at \dword{cern}.

\section{Slow Controls}
% same for SP and DP

The slow controls system collects, archives, and displays data from
a broad variety of sources and provides real-time status, alarms, and warnings for detector operators. Slow controls also provides control for %some detector components of the detector systems 
items such as \dword{hv} systems, \dword{tpc} electronics, and \dword{pd} systems. Data are acquired via network interfaces.  Figure~\ref{fig:gen-slow-controls-diagram} shows connections between major parts of the slow controls system and other systems. Hardware, infrastructure, and software are the three main components of the slow controls system. %, each of which are described in this section.

The \dword{pdsp} detector control system\cite{pdspdcs_proc}  met its operational requirements fully. %the requirements for operating \dword{pdsp}. 
Section~\ref{sec:cisc-slow-control-pdsp} provides a short description of the \dword{pdsp} slow controls and its performance.

 \subsection{Slow Controls Hardware}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-hdwr}

%A modest amount of dedicated hardware is envisioned for 
Slow controls requires a modest amount of dedicated hardware, mostly for rack monitoring,  %Additionally, slow controls will always 
and a small amount of dedicated network and
computing hardware. % as described below. 
Slow controls also relies on common
infrastructure as described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-infra}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Dedicated Monitoring Hardware}

Every rack (including those in the \dword{cuc}) should have dedicated hardware to monitor rack parameters like rack protection system, rack fans, rack air temperatures, thermal interlocks with power supplies, and any interlock bit status monitoring needed for the racks. For the racks in the \dword{cuc} server room, this functionality is built into the proposed water cooled racks, much like what is already in place at \dword{protodune}.  For the racks on the detector itself, the current plan is to design and install a custom-built 1U rack-mount enclosure containing a single-board computer to control and monitor various rack parameters. Such a system has been successfully used in \dword{microboone}. The design is being improved for the \dword{sbnd} experiment (see Figure~\ref{fig:slow-controls-rack-box}). Other slow controls hardware includes interfacing cables like adapters for communication and debugging and other specialized cables like GPIB \fixme{Is GPIB a commonly accepted abbreviation or should it be included in the glossary? CP: I think it is not needed to add it to the glossary, it is commonly accepted.} or National Instruments cables. The cable requirements must be determined in consultation with other groups once hardware choices for various systems are chosen.

\subsubsection{Slow Controls Network Hardware}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-network}
The slow controls data originates from the cryogenic instrumentation and from other systems as listed in Table~\ref{tab:gen-slow-quant}. This data is collected by software running on servers
(see Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-compute})
housed in the underground data room in the \dword{cuc},
where data is archived in a central \dword{cisc} database.
The instrumentation data is transported over
conventional network hardware from any sensors located in the cryogenic
plant.  However, we must remain aware of grounding and noise in readouts in the racks on top of the
cryostats.  Therefore, each
rack on the cryostat has a small network switch that sends
any network traffic from that rack to the \dword{cuc} via a fiber transponder.
This is the only network hardware specific to slow controls and will be provided by %the laboratory's
\surf{}'s  
general computing infrastructure. % managed by project \dword{tc}. 
The network infrastructure requirements are described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-infra}.

% % % % Alec
\subsubsection{Slow Controls Computing Hardware}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-compute}
Two servers (a primary server and a replicated backup) suitable for the relational database discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-sw} are located in the \dword{cuc} data
room along with an additional
two servers for the \dword{fe} monitoring interface. These additional servers would cover assembling dynamic \dword{cisc} monitoring web pages from adjacent
databases.  Yet another server will be needed to run back-end I/O.  Any special purpose software, such as iFix used by the cryogenics experts, would
also run here. One or two additional servers should accommodate these programs.
% (The exact number of iFix machines will be determined based
% on input from the LBNF cryogenics experts.)
Replicating this setup for each module would make commissioning and independent operation easier, accommodate different module
designs (with resulting differences in database tables), and ensure
sufficient capacity.  These four sets of networking hardware would fit tightly into one rack or very comfortably into two. Using the requirements from \dword{cisc}, the \dword{daq} consortium will provide the cost estimates for servers and racks.

\subsection{Slow Controls Infrastructure}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-infra}

The data rate will be in the range of tens of kilobytes per second, given the total number of slow controls quantities and the update rate  
(see Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-quant}), placing minimal demands
on local network infrastructure.
Network traffic out of \surf to \fnal will primarily be database calls
to the central \dword{cisc} database, either from monitoring applications or from
database replication to the offline version of the \dword{cisc} database.  This
traffic requires little bandwidth, so the proposed general purpose
links both out of the %mine 
underground area at \surf and back to \fnal can accommodate the traffic.

Up to two racks of space and appropriate power and cooling are
available in the \dshort{cuc}'s \dword{daq} server room for \dword{cisc} use. This is ample space (see Section
\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-compute}).
%\fixme{[Carmen] Check Anne modification. reference to section \ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-compute} has been removed}
%Somewhat less space than that is currently envisioned, as described in Section

\subsection{Slow Controls Software}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-sw}
%\fixme{SG: does this need any updating based on presentations from Glenn/Alec at the Sept. Collaboration meeting? GAHS: I don't think so. PDSP DCS citation added. SG: okay, taking it out. I agree.}
% same for SP and DP

To provide complete monitoring and control of detector subsystems, the slow controls software includes
%
\begin{itemize}
 \item the control systems base for input and output operations
  and defining processing logic, scan conditions, and alarm conditions;
 \item an alarm server to monitor all channels and send alarm
  messages to operators;
 \item a data archiver for automatic sampling and storing values for history tracking; and 
 \item an integrated operator interface providing display panels for
  controls and monitoring.
\end{itemize}

In addition, the software must be able to 
interface indirectly with external systems (e.g., cryogenics control
system) and databases (e.g., beam database) to export data into
slow controls process variables (or channels) for archiving and status
displays. This allows us to integrate displays and warnings into one
system for the experiment operators and %to provide 
provides integrated
archiving for sampled data in the archived database. As one possibility, an input output controller (IOC) \fixme{If this abbreviation is used frequently, it should be included in the glossary. At the moment, it is not. If it is not used frequently, simply spell out the term instead of using IOC. CP:It is spelled.} running on a central \dword{daq}
server could provide soft channels for these data.
Figure~\ref{fig:gen-slow-controls-diagram} shows a typical workflow of a
slow controls system.

The key features of the software require highly evolved software designed to manage real-time data exchange, scalable
to hundreds of thousands of channels sampled at intervals of hours to seconds as needed. The software
must be well documented, supported, and reliable. The base
software must also allow easy access to any channel by name. The
archiver software must allow data storage in an SQL database with
adjustable rates and thresholds so data
for any channel can be easily retrieved using channel name and time range. Among other key
features, the alarm server software must remember the state, support an
arbitrary number of clients, and provide logic for delayed alarms and
acknowledging alarms. A standard naming
convention for channels will be part of the software to help handle large
numbers of channels and subsystems.



The \dword{protodune} detector control system software \cite{pdspdcs_proc}
provides a prototype for this required \dword{fd} slow
controls software, as described in Section~\ref{sec:cisc-slow-control-pdsp}.

\subsection{Slow Controls Quantities}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-quant}

% starter text from Glenn

\fixme{2nd draft: update total no. of variables once you here from Giovanna/Xavier}

The final set of quantities to monitor will ultimately be determined
by which subsystems are monitored, documented in
appropriate  interface control documents 
%(ICDs) 
\fixme{Again, if this is a frequently used abbreviation, it should be included in the glossary. If not, don't abbreviate at all. CP: done.}, and continually revised based on operational
experience.  The total number of quantities to monitor is roughly estimated by scaling how much is monitored
in \dword{pddp}, approximately 150,000 per \dword{fd} module. % keep 2 digits of precision to be consistent with tables, responsive to LBNC comment [Glenn]
Quantities should update on average no more than once per minute.
Transmitting a single update for each channel at that rate translates to a few thousand updates per second, or a few tens of thousands of bytes per second. While this is not a significant load on a network with an efficient slow controls protocol, it would correspond to approximately 1~TB per year if every timestamp and value were stored.

The monitored subsystems
include the %detector 
cryogenic instrumentation
described in this chapter, the other detector systems, and relevant
infrastructure and external devices. Table \ref{tab:gen-slow-quant}

\subsection{Local Integration}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-slow-loc-integ}

% This subsection is redundant with ``interfaces'', but there is a WBS
% section with the name ``Local integration'' that contains only interfaces,
% so keeping the subsection and adding some text saying what it is.

The local integration of slow controls consists entirely of software
and network interfaces with systems outside the scope of the \dword{detmodule}.
This includes the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item readings from the \dword{lbnf}-managed external cryogenics systems, for status of pumps, flow rates, inlet, and return temperature and pressure, which are implemented via OPC or a similar SCADA interface \fixme{Should OPC or SCADA be included in the glossary?. CP: Done.};
\item beam status, such as protons-on-target, rate, target steering, and beam pulse timing, which are retrieved via the \dword{ifbeam} DB \fixme{When I checked the glossary for the definition of IFBeam, the definition included database, indicating that IFBeam is by definition a database. If this is true, adding DB after IFBeam is redundant and should be eliminated here and elsewhere in the document.}; and 
\item near detector status, which can be retrieved from a common slow controls database.
\end{itemize}
%
Integration occurs after both the slow controls and non-detector
systems are in place.  The \dword{lbnf}-\dword{cisc} interface is managed by the
cryogenics systems working group in \dword{cisc} (see Section~\ref{sec:cisc-slow-controls-org}), which includes members from both \dword{cisc} and \dword{lbnf}. 
The \dword{ifbeam} DB interface for slow controls is an already well established method used in \microboone, \nova, and other \fnal experiments. An internal \dword{nd}/\dword{fd} working group can be established 
to coordinate detector status exchange between the near and far sites.

\subsection{Validation in \dword{protodune}}
\label{sec:cisc-slow-control-pdsp}
%\fixme{CP: Is the validation in ProtoDUNE-SP valid for DP?  Glenn: Yes, we think so...}
\begin{dunefigure}[Diagram of the ProtoDUNE-SP  control system topology]{fig:cisc-NP04-DCS-topology}

\end{dunefigure}

The \dword{protodune} slow control system has met
all requirements for operation of \dword{pdsp}\cite{pdspdcs_proc} and will be used for \dword{pddp}.  The requirements for \dword{protodune} are
nearly identical to those for the \dword{spmod} and \dword{dpmod} other than
total channel count. Of particular note, the \dword{protodune} slow control system unified a heterogenous set of devices and data sources
through several protocols into a
single control system (see
Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-NP04-DCS-topology}). In addition, data were also acquired from external cryogenic and beam
systems.  The topology and data flow of the system matches the general
shape shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gen-slow-controls-diagram}. In this control system, the unified control system base is WinCC OA \cite{winccoa}, a
commercial toolkit used extensively at \dword{cern}, with device interfaces
supported using several standardized interface protocols.

As noted in sections \ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-sw} and \ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-quant},
the %\dword{dune} 
\dword{dpmod} slow control system will produce massive amounts of
data, requiring a sizable database to store the value history and
allow efficient data retrieval. Individually adjustable rates and
thresholds for each channel are key to keeping this database
manageable. The \dword{pdsp} operations provided not only a test of
these features as implemented in the \dword{protodune} slow control system, but also insight into
reasonable values for these archiving parameters for each system.

Moreover, because the \dword{cisc} consortium broadly interacts with other groups, liaisons have been named (see Figure~\ref{fig:gen-slow-cryo-org}). 
A short-term task force formed in 2017-2018 explored cryogenic modeling for the consortium and corresponding simulation needs. A work plan for \dword{cfd} simulations for both \dword{protodune} and \dword{fd} was developed based on input from the task force. 

The \dword{tdr} editors are responsible for the overall editing and delivery of the \dword{tdr} document. Currently, members from new institutes are added to the consortium with the consensus of the consortium board members following an expression of interest petition from the new institute.

\subsection{Institutional Responsibilities}
%\fixme{SG/ACV: DONE}
The \dword{cisc} %slow controls and cryogenic instrumentation 
will be a joint effort for \single and \dual. A single slow controls system will be implemented to serve both the \dword{spmod} and the \dword{dpmod}.

Design and installation of cryogenic systems (e.g., gas analyzers, differential pressure liquid level meters) will be coordinated with \dword{lbnf} and the consortium providing resources and effort; expertise is provided by \dword{lbnf}. \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp} designs for argon instrumentation (e.g., purity monitors, pressure meters, thermometers, cameras) will be the basis for \dword{fd} designs. Design validation, testing, calibration, and performance will be evaluated using \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp} data.

Following the conceptual funding model envisioned for the consortium, various responsibilities have been distributed across institutions within the consortium pending final funding decisions.
%At this stage of the project, these should be considered as ``aspirational'' responsibilities until firm funding decisions are made. 
Table~\ref{tab:cisc-inst-resp} shows the current institutional responsibilities for primary \dword{cisc} subsystems. Only lead institutes are listed in the table for a given effort. For physics and simulations studies and for validation using \dword{protodune}, a number of institutes are involved. A detailed list of tasks and institutional responsibilities are presented in~\cite{bib:docdb5609}.

\subsection{Cost and Labor}
%\fixme{SG/ACV: DONE}
Table \ref{tab:cisc-cost} shows the current cost estimates for the \dword{cisc} subsystems. It also shows the quantity associated with each subsystem and a brief description of what is included in the cost estimate. The cost estimates include only materials and supplies (M\&S) and packing and shipping, but not labor and travel costs. Labor costs depend on personnel category (e.g., faculty, student, technician, post-doc, engineer) and vary by region and institution, so costs are quantified using labor hours needed to fulfill a given task. Table~\ref{tab:cisc-labor} provides estimates of labor hours for each subsystem, totaling \num{95010} labor hours for all \dword{cisc} tasks. 

\fixme{3/25 Anne: Cost and labor hour tables will be automated in early April. Info to come.}

Table \ref{tab:dp-cisc-sched} shows key construction milestones for the \dword{cisc} consortium leading to commissioning of the second \dword{fd} module. \dword{cisc} construction milestones align with the overall construction milestones of the second \dword{fd} module (highlighted in orange in the table). The technology design decisions for \dword{cisc} systems should be made by January 2020 followed by technical design reviews. The production of improved design prototypes (if any) to be deployed at \dword{protodune}-II running should be finished by May 2021 followed by assembly and deployment in \dword{protodune}-II. 

Production of \dword{cisc} systems for the \dword{fd} should start in April 2023, followed by assembly of the systems underground in the detector cavern in early 2025. Installation of instrumentation devices will start in April 2025 following the beneficial occupancy of the cryostat. Installing gas analyzers, level meters, individual temperature sensors, static T-gradient thermometers, and support structure for all instrumentation devices will finished before installing \dword{tpc}, but installing dynamic T-gradient thermometers, purity monitors, and cameras will occur afterward. \dword{cisc} will work closely with \dword{lbnf} to coordinate installation of the cryogenic systems and instrumentation devices. For slow controls, the goal is to have the full slow controls system commissioned and integrated into remote operations at least three months before the \dword{dpmod} is ready for operations.  

%SG: I replaced the table with a different version of the table. Listing schedule WBS numbers is not needed and also it will be important to include the key milestones for the international schedule so it is easy to see that our plans align with that schedule.

\fixme{Risk tables to be automated; Anne to send template via email. 3/25}
\fixme{SG (4/12/19): we have updated the risks for DP. We will put in the table in new format for the next draft as the procedure to autogenerate the table seems unclear.} 

Tables~\ref{tab:fdgen-slow-cryo-risk1}, \ref{tab:fdgen-slow-cryo-risk2}, and \ref{tab:fdgen-slow-cryo-risk3} list the possible risks identified by the \dword{cisc} consortium along with corresponding mitigation strategies. The tables list 18 risks at low and medium level. A more detailed list of risks with additional descriptions can be found in \cite{bib:docdb7192}. The tables show all risks are medium or low level, mitigated with necessary steps and precautions. Risk\#1, where the \dword{pdsp}-based designs are inadequate for \dword{fd}, is important because this requires early validation from \dword{protodune} data so R\&D of alternate designs can be timely. With \dword{pdsp} data now available, the consortium is focused on validating instrumentation designs.

%We will supply each PrM with more fibers thus provide higher intensity light coming from the fibers  In case that the contamination that causes degradation can not be removed completely.  This would also illuminate more surface area of the photocathode and may result in more life to the photocathode as well. 
The best way to mitigate degradation is to place monitors in line with the cryogenics purification system and have them in valves so they can be maintained over time.  This would ensure that the purity of the \dword{lar} is always monitored, even if monitors are not directly in the cryostat.

ID	& Title	& Explanation &	Risk Level	& Mitigation \\ \toprowrule
1	& 
The baseline design (extrapolated from \dword{protodune}s) for any of the instrumentation devices is not adequate for \dword{dune} far detectors	
&
The design of most instrumentation devices is based on extrapolation from \dword{protodune}s (mainly SP) design. Unforeseen problems could be discovered in terms of design and performance during installation, commissioning and data analysis in \dword{protodune}s
&
M
&
This potential problem should be detected as soon as possible (soon after \dword{protodune} data taking starts) such that R\&D on alternative designs can proceed on a reasonable time scale. The concept of those alternative designs should exist by the time of the TDR
\\ \toprowrule
2
&
Lack of involvement/expertise and insufficient input from past experience on instrumentation devices for dual-phase technology
&
\dword{dune} DP far detector will need additional considerations (different \efield structure, more precise LAr level measurements, etc), which are not necessary for the SP detector. Will need involvement and input from current DP experts to arrive at a successful design. 
&
M
&
Seek help from Technical Coordinator and Spokespeople to ensure DP expertise and involvement is provided at the needed level to the Consortium. Information transfer from DP side is critical when direct involvement and contribution is not possible. \\ \toprowrule
3
&
Potential swinging of long instrumentation devices (T-gradient monitors or PrM system) due to e.g. mis-alignment at the top	
&
In principle those systems will hang from the top of the cryostat (either from their flange or from bolts on the corners) and could potentially be anchored at the bottom near the corners for devices that go across the full height of the detector.
&
L
&
Add additional intermediate anchoring points (as needed) to prevent swinging by welding the appropriate element to the cryostat membrane. This option must be discussed with the cryostat management as soon as possible.
\\ \toprowrule
4
&
High electric fields near instrumentation devices (purity monitors, temperature gradients, cameras, etc)
&
The instrumentation systems need to be mounted within the cryostat such that it is far enough away from the FC such as not to cause very high electric fields which could then lead to dielectric breakdown across the LAr.
&
L
&
Instrumentation systems will be placed as far from the cathode, field cage and other TPC components as possible, most likely near the corner of the cryostat, or above/below ground planes, where the fields should be low enough for the system to not require additional shielding from high fields. In the DP FD module, since it is impossible to find low field regions, shielding is anticipated for instrumentation devices to prevent high fields. 
\\ \toprowrule
5
&
Light pollution from purity monitors and camera light emitting system	
&
The light source for the Purity Monitor system or the light emitting system for cameras will produce a lot of UV light in the detector which could potentially interfere with physics measurements and damage the Photon Detector System.  	
&
L
&
PrM and camera systems could be run at definite times and a signal sent to the detector to Veto any signals during PrM or camera system measurements.  For PrMs, software for light source triggering mechanism will be developed to prevent the PrM flash lamp from flashing during photon detector's triggering windows. One can also consider using this light signal to calibrate the photon detector system at the same time.
\\ \toprowrule
6
&
Temperature sensors can induce noise in cold electronics
&
Each temperature sensor is readout with a cable with four wires, which are shielded against EM noise. The shield should be connected to ground. If this connection is not properly done EM noise from outside the cryostat can be introduced through the cables
&
M
&
If noise is discovered before filling the cryostat check all connections, mainly the ones to ground. If noise is discovered after cryostat filling try to solve the problem at the readout level (e.g. noise filters). If problem persists connect offending sensors to ground using dummy connectors with all pins grounded  
\\ \toprowrule
7
&
Disagreement between lab and {\em in situ} calibrations for \dword{pdsp} dynamic T-gradient monitor
&
Temperature sensors in the dynamic T-gradient monitor are calibrated using two methods: lab calibration to \SI{0.002}{K} (as in the static T-gradient monitor)  and {\em in situ} cross-calibration moving the system vertically.
&
M
&
Try to understand which of the two calibrations is wrong or has more limitations. Try to improve both methods, specially the laboratory calibration since this is the only one possible for sensors behind APAs, and top/bottom of the detector. 
\\ \toprowrule
8
&
Discrepancies between measured temperature map and \dword{cfd} simulations in \dword{pdsp}
&
Significant discrepancies between real data and simulations. Can have potential impact on physics as physics relies on simulations to extract various calibration quantities.
&
L
&
Improve simulations with more precise  inputs from real measurements: liquid argon flows, temperature of incoming LAr and temperature of gas argon in the ullage, etc. Use a fraction of T-sensors to predict temperatures in others.  
\\ \toprowrule
9
&
Experience with \dword{protodune} shows that it is difficult to correlate data from PrMs and Thermometers
&
Liquid argon purity as measured by the purity monitors, and vertical temperature gradients should be correlated and this correlation is important to understand the behavior of cryogenics system.
&
L
&
Understand what aspect (design, drift physics etc.) is causing the discrepancy and if any modifications in the design are needed to arrive at better agreement. One option could be to instrument the purity monitors with temperature sensors such that purity and temperature are measured in the same location
\\ \toprowrule
10
&
During R\&D phase the CISC consortium is not able to build a working prototype for cold cameras that meet all the requirements \& safety
&
Cold cameras are not able to work for longtime or show low performance (e.g. delays, bad resolution)
&
M
&
Further pursue R\&D: Improve thermal insulation and heaters, use alternative camera models, etc. If problems persist use cameras at the ullage with the appropriate field of view and lighting  such that elements inside LAr can be inspected. Also, better understand the importance of the cold cameras for HV diagnosis and if not having them will put HV at risk.
\\ \toprowrule
11
&
HV discharge caused by the cameras
&
Cameras can induce HV discharge. Unlike other instrumentation devices which will mostly be fixed at one location, cameras will be deployed as needed (within safety limits) to inspect or monitor HV activity.
&
M
&
Electric field in the camera housing and related anchoring systems must be studied carefully such that the proper shielding is used. Eventually those could be tested in a HV testing facility
\\ \toprowrule
12
&
HV discharge destroying the cameras
&
Cameras are delicate devices as some of them will be located near HV devices. Provided the proper shielding it is very unlikely that cameras are destroyed by discharges, but there is some risk
&
M
&
The most important cameras should have enough redundancy such that the lost of one camera does not compromise the overall performance 
\\ \toprowrule
13
&
Cameras have Insufficient light to see
&
Specially important will be the attenuation of light inside LAr, which could prevent cameras from seen things in deep areas of the cryostat.
&
M
&
Cameras will have to be tested during the R\&D phase under conditions of illumination similar to the ones of the actual detector. The cryogenics test facility should have sufficient depth for testing the ability of seen deep objects.
\\ \toprowrule
14
&
Cameras may induce noise in cold electronics
&
Noise from the consumer grade electronics used by the camera systems and how it interacts with the surrounding detector elements.
&
M
&
Need to work with the camera team and grounding and shielding group to further understand this concern and develop possible mitigation strategies.
\\ \toprowrule
15
&
Purity monitors electronics introduces noise in cold electronics
&
The only electric noise from PrM is caused by the current surge in the  discharging process of the  main capacitor of the xenon light source when producing a flash
&
M
&
Develop software for light source triggering mechanism to prevent the PrM flash lamp from flashing during photon detector data taking. Use Faraday cage to ground the light source. 
\\ \toprowrule
16
&
Light attenuation in long optic fibers for Purity Monitors
&
For the PrMons at the bottom of the cryostat, if the fibers are too long the attenuation of the light inside them could be too much and not provide enough intensity to give enough drift elections to make the measurement.
&
M
&
Test the maximum length of fiber that can be used. The depth of the bottom PrMons would then be optimized based on this measurement and the number of fibers that is reasonable to run to the bottom PrMons.
\\ \toprowrule
17
&
Longevity of Purity Monitors
&
The current design of these devices could fail if operated in impure liquid or gas argon because of the degradation of photocathode for a long time. A significant photocathode degradation was observed during LAPD running when the cryo-pump failed for a few days. In principle, since Purity Monitors are most useful during commissioning, this may not be a major issue but since cosmic muons will be sparse in the FD, with no purity monitors, we may be at a risk for monitoring purity especially after recovering from cryogenic issues, power outages etc. when one cannot use tracks to make the purity measurement.
&
M
&
This problem can be solved by design software deadlock to prevent PrMs from running a long time when detecting a very low purity. The degradation can be recovered by running high frequency and intensity xenon flashes for a few days after purity recovered. The degradation can also be recovered by using RTD to heat cathode, because the primary contamination on a degraded cathode surface is likely to be ice or water compound from the impurity. We will supply each PrM with more fibers thus provide higher intensity light coming from the fibers  In case that the contamination that causes degradation can not be removed completely.  This would also illuminate more surface area of the photocathode and may result in more life to the photocathode as well.  The best way to mitigate this degradation problem is to have the monitors which are inline with the cryogenics purification system and have them valves so they can be maintained over time.  This would ensure that the purity of the LAr is always being monitored, even if not directly in the cryostat.

\subsection{Interfaces}  % Tim B. confirms "Interfaces" is standard term used in HEP-speak for what this section covers. I have rewritten introductory sentence to separately address system interfaces and inter-group interactions. =Glenn.
\label{sec:interfaces}

\dword{cisc} subsystems interface with all other detector subsystems and could affect the work of all detector consortia, as well as some
working groups (physics, software/computing, beam instrumentation), and technical coordination, requiring interactions with all of these entities.  We also interact heavily with \dword{lbnf} beam and cryogenics groups.  
Detailed descriptions of \dword{cisc} interfaces are maintained in \dword{dune} DocDB. A brief summary is provided in this section. Table~\ref{tab:fdgen-cisc-interfaces} lists the IDs of the different DocDB documents as well as their highlights. Descriptions of the interfaces and interactions that affect many systems follow. 

Obviously, \dword{cisc} interacts with the detector consortia because \dword{cisc} will provide status monitoring of all important detector sub-systems along with controls for some components of the detector.
%full rack monitoring (rack fans, thermometers and rack protection system), interlock status bit monitoring (not the actual interlock mechanism) and monitoring and control for all power supplies (PS).
\dword{cisc} will also consult on selecting different power supplies to ensure monitoring and control can be established with preferred types of communication. 
Rack space distribution and interaction between slow controls and other modules from other consortia will be managed by \dword{tc} in consultation with those consortia. 

If heaters/\dwords{rtd} are needed on flanges, \dword{cisc} will specify the heaters/\dwords{rtd} and will provide the readout/control, while the responsibility for the actual hardware will be discussed with the different groups.  

Installing instrumentation devices will interfere with other devices and must be coordinated with the appropriate consortia.  
On the software side, \dword{cisc} must define, in coordination with other consortia/groups, the quantities to be monitored/controlled by slow controls and the corresponding alarms,
archiving, and GUIs.

\subsubsection{Purity Monitors}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-pm}

%\fixme{IIC Purity Monitors: too much repetition. It can be shortened. To be reviewed: [CP] slightly modified to avoid repetitions}

The purity monitor system will be built in modules, so it can be assembled outside the %\dword{dune} \dword{fd} 
cryostat  
%The assembly of the purity monitors themselves would occur outside of the cryostat and would include everything described in the previous section.  The installation of the purity monitor system can then be carried out 
%with the fewest steps left to 
leaving few steps to complete inside the cryostat.  The assembly itself %should
 comes into the cryostat with the individual purity monitors mounted to support tubes and with no \dword{hv} cables or optical fibers yet installed.  The support tube at the top and bottom of the assembly %would then be 
 is then mounted to the brackets inside the cryostat and  %; the brackets could be 
 the brackets attached to the cables trays and/or the detector support structure.  At much the same time, the \dword{fe} electronics and light source can be installed on top of the cryostat, and the electronics and power supplies can be installed in the electronics rack.  

Integration %would 
begins by running the  \dword{hv} cables and optical fibers to the purity monitors through the top of the cryostat.  These cables %would be 
are attached to the  \dword{hv}  feedthroughs with sufficient length to reach each purity monitor inside the cryostat.  
The cables %would be 
are run along cable trays through the port reserved for the purity monitor system. 
%inside the cryostat until they reach the purity monitor system, and would then be terminated through the support tube down to each of the purity monitors.  
Each purity monitor will have three  \dword{hv} cables that connect it to the feedthrough and then further along to the  \dword{fe} electronics.  The optical fibers %would then be 
are then run through the special optical fiber feedthrough into the cryostat and %would be 
guided to the purity monitor system either using the cables trays or guide tubes, depending on which solution is adopted. 
%for running the optical fibers from the feedthrough to the purity monitor system, 
This should protect fibers from breaking accidentally as the rest of the detector and instrumentation installation continues.  The optical fibers %would then be 
are then run inside the purity monitor support tube and to the appropriate purity monitor, terminating the fibers at the photocathode of each monitor while protecting them from breaking near the purity monitor system itself.

Integration %would 
continues as the  \dword{hv} cables are connected through the feedthrough to the system  \dword{fe} electronics; then optical fibers are connected to the light source.  The cables connecting the \dword{fe} electronics and the light source to the electronics rack %would also be 
are also run and connected at this time.  This allows the system to be turned on and the software to begin testing the various components and connections.  Once all connections are confirmed successful, integration with the slow controls system begins, first by establishing communication between the two systems and then transferring data between them to ensure successful exchange of important system parameters and measurements.  

Commissioning the purity monitor system is considered % would be
 official once the cryostat is purged and a gaseous argon atmosphere is present.  At this time, the \dword{hv} for the purity monitors %could be ramped up without fear of discharge
  is ramped up without risk of discharge through the air, and the light source turned on.  Although the drift electron lifetime in the gaseous argon would be very large and therefore not %really 
  measurable with the purity monitors themselves, the signal strength at both the cathode and anode will %would 
  give a good indication of how well the light source generates drift electrons from the photocathode. % and  that the electrons successfully drift to the anode by looking at the signal strength at the anode and comparing it to the cathode signal strength.
 Comparing the signal strengths at the anode and cathode will indicate whether the electrons successfully drift to the anode.

\subsubsection{Thermometers}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-th}

%\fixme{AC: working on this. We need a clear design in order to outline the installation steps. ACV. DONE, this is general enough such that it does not depend much on the exact design}
\paragraph{Static T-gradient monitors}
 %should 
will be installed after \dwords{fc} along the long cryostat sides. The profiles %will be 
are preassembled before they are delivered to \surf. 
Installation begins by anchoring the support holding the two vertical strings to bolts on the top corner of the cryostat. All cables can then be routed to the assigned cryostat ports. Second, the array is unrolled using a scissor lift, and once at the bottom, it is attached to bolts on the bottom corner of the cryostat. After checking string tension and verticality, cable and sensors supports are checked, and the individual Faraday cages are installed. A precision resistor is plugged into each IDC-4 connector so noise studies can be performed. Sensors will be installed later. 

\paragraph{Individual temperature sensors} on pipes/\dshort{pd}s\footnote{Actually on \dshort{pd}'s support structure}  and cryostat floor %will be 
should be installed after \dword{pd}s and the grounding grid. First, vertical strings for cable routing %will be 
are installed following a procedure similar to the one described above for the static T-gradient monitors. Next, all cable supports are anchored to pipes/\dshort{pd}s. Then each cable %will be 
is routed individually starting from the sensor end (with IDC-4 female connector but without the sensor)
to the corresponding cryostat port. Once all cables going through the same port have been routed, the cables are cut to the same length, so they can be properly assembled into the corresponding connector(s). To avoid damaging them, sensors are installed later, once all operations at the bottom of the cryostat are complete. 

 

% \fixme{Please check the following! I have reworded the paragraph on
%   dynamic T-gradient installation significantly to address editors'
%   comments while keeping the original meaning as I understood it.
%   =Glenn. Anselmo: It looks OK to me but Jelena should check, {\bf Glenn is checking with Jelena.} {\em Jelena is checking... (2019-01-11)}}

%\fixme{AC: Has been REVIEWED BY JELENA }

\paragraph{Dynamic T-gradient monitors} %will be 
are installed
after the \dword{tpc} components are in place.
Figure~\ref{fig:fd-slow-cryo-dt-monitor-overview} shows the
design of the dynamic T-gradient monitor with its sensor carrier rod,
enclosure above the cryostat, and stepper motor. 
 Figure~\ref{fig:fd-slow-cryo-sensor-mount} shows detailed views of key
components.  Each monitor %will 
comes in several segments with sensors
and cabling already in place. Additional slack will be provided at
segment joints to make installation easier. Segments of the sensor
carrier rod with preattached sensors %will be 
are fed into the flange one
at a time. Each segment, as it is fed into the %detector
cryostat, is % will be
held at the top with a pin that prevents the segment from sliding all
the way in. %to the detector. 
The next segment %will be 
is connected at that
time to the previous segment. Then the pin %will be 
is removed, the first
segment %will be 
is pushed down, and the next segment top %will be 
is held
with the pin at the flange. This process %will be 
is repeated for each
segment %to be installed 
until the entire sensor carrier rod is in
place.  Next, the enclosure %will be 
is installed on top of the flange,
starting with the six-way cross at the bottom of the enclosure.  (See
 Figure~\ref{fig:fd-slow-cryo-sensor-mount}, right.)  Again, extra cable
slack at the top will be provided to ease connection to the D-sub
flange and allow the entire system to move vertically.  The wires
%will be 
are connected to a D-sub connector on the \fdth on one side port
of the cross. Finally, a crane %will be used to 
positions the remainder
of the enclosure over the top of the cross.  This enclosure includes
the mechanism used to move the sensor rod, which %will be 
is preassembled,
with the motor in place, on the side of the enclosure, and the pinion
and gear is used to move the sensor inside the enclosure.  The pinion
%will be 
is connected to the top of the rod. The enclosure is then %will then be
connected to top part of the cross, which finishes the installation of
the dynamic T-gradient monitor.

\fixme{ACV: Text added. To be checked by experts. I'll send email to Dominique}

\paragraph{Vertical arrays in gas phase,} with the baseline design assuming twenty arrays, are each attached to a \dword{crp} frame. Thus, they should be installed on the corresponding \dword{crp} before being moved into the cryostat. Cables will be routed to the assigned cryostat port using the appropriate elements on the \dword{crp} frame. 

Commissioning all thermometers will occur in several steps. In the first stage, only cables %will be 
are installed, so
the readout performance and the noise level inside the cryostat %will be
is tested with precision resistors. Once sensors are installed, the entire chain %will be 
is checked again at room temperature.
The final commissioning phase %will be done 
takes place during and after cryostat filling.  


\subsubsection{Gas Analyzers}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-ga}
%\fixme{IIC Gas Analyzers: To be reviewed}

%\fixme{AC: VALID SUBSECTION}

The gas analyzers %should be 
are installed before the piston purge and gas recirculation phases of the cryostat commissioning. They %should be 
are installed near the tubing switchyard to minimize tubing run length and for convenience when switching the sampling points and gas analyzers. Because each is a standalone module, a single rack with shelves %should be 
is adequate to house the modules.

For integration, the gas analyzers typically have an analog output (\SIrange{4}{20}{mA} or \SIrange{0}{10}{V}), which maps to the input range of the analyzers. They also usually have several relays to indicate the scale they are currently running. These outputs can be connected to the slow controls for readout. However, using a digital readout is preferable because this gives a direct analyzer reading at any scale. Currently, the digital output connections are RS-232, RS-485, USB, and Ethernet. The preferred option is chosen at the time of purchase. %When they are purchased, the preferred option can be chosen, but the available protocols for the modules may change. 

The readout usually responds to a simple set of text query commands. Because of the natural time scales of the gas analyzers and lags in gas delivery times (which depend on the length of the tubing run), sampling every minute is adequate.

The analyzers %should 
must be brought online and calibrated before beginning the gas phase of the cryostat commissioning.  Calibration varies by module because they differ, but calibration often requires using argon gas with zero contaminants, and argon gas with a known level of the contaminant to check the scale. Contaminants are usually removed with a local inline filter for the first gas sample. %The gas phase of the cryostat 
This gas phase usually begins with normal air, with the more sensitive analyzers valved off at the switchyard to prevent overloading their inputs (and potentially saturating their detectors). As the argon purge and gas recirculation progress, the various analyzers %will be 
are valved back in when the contaminant levels reach the upper limits of the analyzer ranges. 

\subsubsection{Liquid Level Monitoring}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-llm}

%\fixme{AC: DONE. Slightly modified}

\dword{lbnf} will install differential pressure level meters, but the capacitive level meters fall within scope of \dword{cisc}. The exact number of capacitive level meters is not yet decided. We will need at least four, one for each of the four corners of the cryostat.  
They will be attached to the M10 bolts in the cryostat corners after the detector is installed. If additional capacitive level meters are needed in the central part of the cryostat, those will be installed after the nearby \dword{fc} modules, attaching them to the bolts in the top cryostat corner\footnote{These level meters must be shorter because no bolts run vertically as they do for the other level meters}. In all cases, cables will be routed to the appropriate nearby port (not yet assigned). 

\subsubsection{Pressure Meters}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-press}
\fixme{SG: to be reviewed by experts}
\dword{cisc} will install the pressure meters. Six sensors will be mechanically installed in two dedicated flanges (three sensors each) at opposite sides of the cryostat after the detector is installed. Cables will be routed through the dedicated ports assigned for these devices. The pressure signals (absolute and relative) are read and converted to electrical signals corresponding to 4...20~mA range. A twisted pair shielded cable connects the sensors to the slow controls \dword{plc} controller using software to convert electrical signals to pressure values.  

\subsubsection{Cameras and light emitting system}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-c}
%\fixme{IIC Cameras: To be reviewed}

%\fixme{Reviewed by Glenn, updated light source installation. Done.}

Installing fixed cameras is, in principle, simple but involves several interfaces. The enclosure of each camera has
exterior threaded holes for mounting the cameras on the cryostat wall,
cryogenic internal piping, or \dword{dss}. Each
enclosure %will be 
is attached to a gas line to maintain appropriate
underpressure in the fill gas; %and so 
therefore, an interface with cryogenic
internal piping will be necessary. Each camera has a cable (coaxial or
optical) for the video signal and a multiconductor cable for power and
control. These %will be 
are run through cable trays to flanges on assigned
instrumentation feedthroughs.

The inspection camera is designed to be inserted and removed on any
instrumentation feedthrough equipped with a gate valve at any time
during operation.  Installing the gate valves and purge system
for instrumentation feedthroughs falls under cryogenic internal
piping.

Fixed lighting sources separate from the cameras
are mounted on cryostat wall, cryogenic internal piping, or
\dword{dss}, and multiconductor cables for power are run through cable
trays to flanges on assigned instrumentation feedthroughs.



\subsubsection{Slow Controls Hardware}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-sc-hard}
%\fixme{IIC Slow Controls Hardware: To be reviewed}

Slow controls hardware installation %will 
includes several
servers, network cables, any specialized cables needed
for device communication, and possibly some custom-built hardware for monitoring racks. The installation sequence will be 
planned with the facilities group and other consortia. The network
cables and rack monitoring hardware will be common across many racks
and will be installed first as part of the basic rack installation as %which will 
led by the facilities group. Specialized cables needed for slow controls and servers %will be 
are installed
after the common rack hardware. Selecting and installing these cables will be coordinated
with other consortia, and server installation will be coordinated with the \dword{daq} group.
%\fixme{selection and installation of these things will be coordinated..? GLENN AND CARMEN TO CHECK -MISSED THIS WITH TIM}

\subsubsection{Transport, handling, and storage}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-install-transport}

% Commented out the "fixme" below because some ITF operations are described
%\fixme{IIC Transport, handling, and storage: describe operations at ITF (does this need to be expanded? [gahs])}

Most instrumentation devices will be shipped in pieces to \surf via the \dword{itf} and mounted on site. 
Instrumentation devices are, in general, small except   %other than 
the support structures for purity monitors and dynamic T-gradient monitors
that will cover the entire height of the cryostat. The load on those structures is relatively small (\(<\SI{100}{kg}\)), so they can be fabricated in sections smaller than \SI{3}{m},
which can be easily transported to \surf, down the shaft, and through the tunnels.
All instrumention devices except the dynamic T-gradient monitors can be moved into the cryostat without the crane. The dynamic T-gradient monitors, which %will be 
are introduced into the cryostat from above, %will 
require a crane for installing  the external enclosure (with preassembled motor, pinion, and gear). % on top of the cryostat. 


\subsection{Quality Control}
\label{sec:fdsp-slow-cryo-qc}
%\fixme{CP: Reviewed. Minor modifications and fixmes added. ACV: checked --> OK}
%\fixme{SG (4/15): pressure meters missing under QC}
The manufacturer and the institution in charge of device assembly will conduct a series of tests to ensure the equipment can perform its intended function as part of \dword{qc}. \dword{qc} also includes post-fabrication tests and tests run after shipping and installation. For complex systems, the entire system will be tested before shipping. 
Additional \dword{qc} procedures can be performed at the \dword{citf} and underground after installation. % as much as possible. 

The planned tests for each subsystem are described below.  

%\fixme{QC: To be reviewed}

\subsubsection{Purity monitors}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-pm}


The purity monitor system will undergo a series of tests to ensure the
system performs as intended. These tests 
%reflect the \dword{pdsp} purity monitor QC tests, which included
include electronic tests
with a pulse generator, mechanical and electrical connectivity tests
at cryogenic temperatures in a cryostat, and vacuum tests for short
and full assemblies in a dewar and in a long vacuum tube.

The \dword{qc} tests for \dword{fd} purity monitors begin with testing
individual purity monitors in vacuum after each is fabricated and
assembled.  This test checks the amplitude of the signal generated by
the drift electrons at the cathode and anode to ensure the
photocathode can provide sufficient numbers of photoelectrons to
measure the signal attenuation
with the required precision and the field gradient resistors all work properly to maintain the drift field. %and hence transport the drift electrons to the anode.  
A smaller version of the assembly with all purity monitors installed will be tested in the \lar test facility to ensure the full system performs as expected in \lar and to study systematics that may influence the measured lifetime.

Next, %after individual testing would be 
the entire system %will be 
is assembled on the full-length mounting tubes to check connections.  Ensuring that all electric and optical connections are operating properly during this test reduces the risk of problems once the full system is assembled and ready for the final test in vacuum.  %With the full system assembled it would be 
The fully assembled system %can be 
is placed in the shipping tube, which %can 
serves as a vacuum chamber, and tested at \surf %on the \dword{fd} site
 before the system is inserted into the  %\dword{fd}  
 cryostat. During insertion, electrical connections %will be 
 are tested continuously with multimeters and electrometers. % and a test made with the system in vacuum.  
%This would ensure that the performance seen during the individual purity monitors tests can still be achieved after making the final assembly.  
%Next, assuming an adequate \lar test facility is available, a test at \lar temperature is made to ensure the required performance.



\subsubsection{Thermometers}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-th}

\paragraph{Static T-gradient thermometers:}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-thst}

Static T-gradient monitors undergo three type of tests at the production site before %they are shipped 
shipping to \surf: a mechanical rigidity test, a calibration of all sensors, and a test of all electrical cables and connectors.
Mechanical rigidity is tested by installing the static T-gradient monitor between two dummy cryostat corners mounted \SI{15}{m} apart. The tension of the strings is set to match the tension that would occur in a vertical deployment in \lar, and the deflection of the sensor and electrical cable strings is measured and compared to the expected value; this ensures any swinging or deflection of the deployed static T-gradient monitor will be < \SI{5}{cm}, mitigating any risk of touching the \dword{fc}s and the cryostat membrane.
The laboratory calibration of sensors will be performed 
%The sensor calibration is performed in the laboratory, 
%\fixme{which lab? 'in situ' at SURF? GLENN AND CARMEN TO CHECK} 
as explained in Section~\ref{sec:fddp-cryo-therm}. The main concern is reproducibility of results because sensors could change resistance and hence their temperature scale when undergoing successive immersions in \lar. In this case, the calibration procedure itself provides \dword{qc} because each set of sensors goes through five independent measurements. Sensors with \rms variation outside the requirement (\SI{2}{mK} for \dword{pdsp}) are discarded. This calibration also serves as \dword{qc} for the readout system (similar to the final one) and of the \dword{pcb}-sensor-connector assembly.
Finally, the cable-connector assemblies are tested; sensors must measure the expected values with no additional noise introduced by either cable or connector. 

%If there is a \lar test facility with sufficient height or length to test a good portion of the system and it is available for use,

%An integrated system test is conducted at the \lar test facility on site, which has sufficient linear dimension (>\SI{2}{m}) to test a good portion of the system. This %, which 
%ensures that  the system
%operates in \lar at the required level of performance.
%The laboratory sensor calibration %will be 
%is compared with the in situ calibration
%of the dynamic T-gradient monitors by operating both dynamic and static T-gradient monitors %simultaneously.   
%\fixme{CP: new paragraph replacing the old one with references to LAr test facility at SURF and calibration with dynamic thermometers. ACV: OK}
An integrated system test at a \lar test facility on site, which has sufficient linear dimension (>\SI{2}{m}) to test a good portion of the system, would be desirable. This ensures that  the system
operates in \lar at the required performance level.

The last phase of \dword{qc} takes place after installation. %For each of the arrays being installed the verticality of the system can be checked and the tension of the stainless steel strings can be adjusted to avoid lateral swinging towards the \dwords{apa}. 
The verticality of each array %will be 
is checked, and the tensions in the stainless steel strings adjusted as necessary.
Before closing the flange, the entire readout chain is %will be 
tested.  
This allows a test of the sensor-connector assembly, the cable-connector assemblies at both ends, and the noise level inside the cryostat.
If any sensor presents a problem, it is replaced. If the problem persists, the cable is checked and replaced as needed.

%\fixme{To be removed in case no Dynamic T-gradient thermometers in DP. ACV. Lets assume there is one for the moment}
\paragraph{Dynamic T-gradient thermometers:}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-thdy}

The dynamic T-gradient monitor consists of an array of high-precision temperature sensors mounted on a vertical rod. The rod can move vertically to cross-calibrate the temperature sensors \textit{in situ}. %{\em in situ}. 
We will use the following %several 
tests to ensure that the dynamic T-gradient monitor delivers vertical temperature gradient measurements with a precision of a few \si{mK}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Before installation, temperature sensors are tested in LN \fixme{LN is not in the common glossary. Does the abbreviation need to be defined? If so, it should be added.} to verify correct operation and to set the baseline calibration for each sensor to the absolutely calibrated reference sensor. 
\item
Warm and cold temperature readings are taken with each sensor after it is mounted on the \dword{pcb} board and the readout cables are soldered. %of .
\item
The sensor readout is taken for all sensors after the cold cables are connected to electric \fdth{}s on the flange and the warm cables outside of the cryostat are connected to the temperature readout system.
\item 
The stepper motor is tested before and after connecting to the gear and pinion system.
\item
The fully assembled rod is connected to the pinion and gear and moved with the stepper motor on a high platform many times to verify repeatability, possible offsets, and any uncertainty in positioning. Finally, repeating this test many times will verify the sturdiness of the system.
\item
The full system is tested after it is installed in the cryostat; both motion and sensor operation are tested by checking % readout for sensors and motion of the system vertically. 
sensor readout and vertical motion of the system.
\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Individual sensors:}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-is}

To address the quality of individual precision sensors, the same method is used as for the static T-gradient monitors %will be 
.
The \dword{qc} of the sensors is part of the laboratory calibration. After mounting six sensors with their corresponding cables, a
SUBD-25 connector %will be 
is added, and the six sensors tested at room temperature. All sensors %should 
must %work and 
give values within specifications.  
If any of the sensors present problems, they are replaced.  If the problem persists, the cable is checked and replaced as needed.

For standard \dwords{rtd} to be installed on the cryostat walls, floor, and roof, calibration is not an issue. Any \dword{qc} required for associated cables and connectors %will be 
is performed following the same procedure as for precision sensors. 

%\fixme{CP: do we want to mention here the gas phase thermometers as well?. ACV: Absolutely. I've added a section below. }

\paragraph{Vertical arrays in gas phase:}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-gs}

These thermometers use standard \dwords{rtd} that require no calibration.  Any \dword{qc} required for associated cables and connectors is performed following the same procedure as for precision sensors. The appropriate \dword{qc} procedure for the \dword{pcb} support structure will be elaborated once this is designed.  


\subsubsection{Gas analyzers}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-ga}


The gas analyzers will be guaranteed by the manufacturer. However, once received, the gas analyzer modules %will be 
are checked for both \textit{zero} and the \textit{span} values using a gas-mixing instrument and two gas cylinders, one having a zero level of the gas analyzer contaminant species and the other cylinder with a known percentage of the contaminant gas. This %should
 verifies the proper operation of the gas analyzers. When they are installed at \surf, this process %will be 
 is repeated before commissioning the cryostat. Calibrations must be repeated %at times recommended by the 
 using manufacturer recommendations over the gas analyzer lifetime.


\subsubsection{Liquid level monitoring}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-llm}

The manufacturer will provide the \dword{qc} for the differential pressure level meters; further \dword{qc} during and after installation %will be 
is the responsibility of \dword{lbnf}.

The capacitive sensors will be tested with a modest sample of \lar in the laboratory before they are installed. After installation, they are tested \textit{in situ} %{\em in situ} 
using a suitable dielectric in contact with the sensor.

\subsubsection{Pressure meters}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-press}
\fixme{SG: to be reviewed by experts}
The manufacturer will provide the \dword{qc} for the pressure meters; \dword{cisc} will provide further \dword{qc} during and after installation.

The pressure sensors will be tested with a modest sample of gaseous argon in the laboratory before they are installed. After installation, they are tested \textit{in situ} at atmospheric pressure. The whole pressure readout chain, (including slow controls \dword{plc} and WINCC conversion) will also be tested and cross-checked with \dword{lbnf} pressure sensors.

\subsubsection{Cameras}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-c}

Before %being 
transport to \surf, each cryogenic camera unit (comprising the enclosure, camera, and internal thermal control and monitoring) %will be 
is checked for correct operation of all features, for recovery from \SI{87}{K} non-operating mode, for leakage, and for physical defects. Lighting systems %will be 
are similarly checked. Operations tests will verify correct current draw, image quality, and temperature readback and control. Each movable inspection camera apparatus %will be 
is inspected for physical defects and checked for proper mechanical operation before shipping. A checklist %will be 
is created for each unit, filed electronically in the \dword{dune} logbook, and a hard copy is sent with each unit. 

%Before installation, each fixed cryogenic camera unit is inspected for physical damage or defects and checked in the cryogenics test facility  for correct operation of all features, 
Before installation, each fixed cryogenic camera unit is inspected for physical damage or defects and checked in a cryogenics test facility  for correct operation of all features, 
for recovery from \SI{87}{K} non-operating mode, and for contamination of the \lar{}. Lighting systems are similarly checked. Operations tests verify correct current draw, image quality, and temperature readback and control. After installing and connecting the wiring, fixed cameras and lighting are again  checked for operation. The movable inspection camera apparatus is inspected for physical defects and, after integration with a camera unit, tested in the facility for proper mechanical and electronic operation and cleanliness before being installed or stored. A checklist will be completed for each \dword{qc} check and filed electronically in the \dword{dune} logbook. 

\subsubsection{Light-emitting system}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-qc-les}

The entire light-emitting system is checked before installation to ensure functionality of light emission. 
Initial testing of the system (see Figure~\ref{fig:cisc-LED}) begins with
measuring the current when low voltage (\SI{1}{V}) is applied to check
that the resistive \dword{led} failover path is correct. Next, the forward voltage is measured using nominal forward current to
check that it is within \SI{10}{\%} of the nominal forward voltage drop of
the \dword{led}, that all of the \dwords{led} are illuminated, and that each \dword{led} is visible over the nominal angular range. If the \dwords{led} are
infrared, a video camera with the IR filter removed is used for a
visual check. This procedure is then duplicated with the current
reversed for \dwords{led} oriented in the opposite direction. Initial tests are performed at room temperature and then repeated in LN. \fixme{I am assuming LN is liquid nitrogen. Does LN need to go in the common glossary?} Color shifts in the \dwords{led} are expected and will be noted. A checklist is completed for each \dword{qc} check and filed electronically in the \dword{dune} logbook.

Room temperature tests are repeated during and immediately after installation to ensure that the system has not been damaged during transportation or installation. Functionality checks of the \dwords{led} are repeated after the cameras are installed in the cryostat.

\subsubsection{Slow controls hardware}
\label{sec:fdsp-slow-cryo-qc-sc-hard}

Networking and computing systems will be purchased commercially, requiring \dword{qa}. The new servers %will be 
are tested after delivery to confirm they suffered no damage during shipping. The new system is allowed to burn in overnight or for a few days, 
running a diagnostics suite on a loop to validate %. This should turn up anything that escaped 
the manufacturer's \dword{qa} process.

The system %can be 
is shipped directly to \surf
where an on site
expert %will 
boots the systems and does basic
configuration. %Then s
Specific configuration information %will be 
is pulled over
the network, after which others may log in remotely to do the final
set up, minimizing the number of people underground.


\subsection{Safety}
%\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-safety}
%\fixme{SG: is this a valid section for DP? any changes?. ACV: I don't think we need to add anything}
Safety %should be taken into account 
is critical during %the different 
all phases of the \dword{cisc} project, including R\&D, laboratory calibration and testing, mounting tests, and installation. 
Safety experts %will 
review and approve the initial safety planning for all phases as part of the initial design review, as well as %always 
before implementation. 
All documentation of component cleaning, assembly, testing, and installation will include a section on relevant safety concerns and will be reviewed during appropriate pre-production reviews.

Several areas are of particular importance to \dword{cisc}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Hazardous chemicals (e.g., epoxy compounds used to attach sensors to cryostat inner membrane) and cleaning compounds:
  All chemicals used will be documented at the consortium management level, with a MSDS (material safety data sheet) \fixme{MSDS is not in the common glossary nor the document glossary. Should it be included? If it is used only once, then instead of abbreviating, simply spell it out.} and approved handling and disposal plans in place.

\item Liquid and gaseous cryogens used in calibrating and testing: LN and \lar %will be 
are used to calibrate and test instrumentation devices.
  Full hazard analysis plans will be in place at the consortium management level for full module or
  module component testing that involves %cryogenic hazards. 
  cryogens. These safety plans will be reviewed in appropriate pre-production and production reviews.

\item High voltage safety:  Purity monitors %will 
have a voltage of $\sim\,$\SI{2}{kV}. Fabrication and testing plans will show compliance with local
  \dword{hv} safety requirements at %whichever 
  any institution or laboratory that conducts testing or operation, and this compliance will be reviewed as part of the standard review process.

%\item UV and VUV light exposure:  Some QA and QC procedures used for module testing and qualification may require use of UV and/or VUV light sources, which can be hazardous  to unprotected operators.  Full safety plans must be in place and reviewed by consortium management prior to beginning such testing.

\item Working at heights: Some fabrication, testing, and installation of \dword{cisc} devices require working at heights.
  Both T-gradient monitors and purity monitors, which span the height of the detector, require working at heights exceeding \SI{10}{m}.
  Temperature sensors installed near the top cryostat membrane and cable routing for all instrumentation devices
  %will 
  also require working at heights. % as well. 
  The appropriate safety procedures, including lift and harness training, will be designed and reviewed. 
  
\item Falling objects: all work involving heights has associated risks of falling objects. The corresponding safety procedures, including proper helmet use 
and a well restricted safety area, will be included in the safety plan.
