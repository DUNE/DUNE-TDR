The design of the \dual electronics system takes into account several risk factors, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:dp-tpcelec-risks}. While the actual design was completed in 2016, the production for \dword{dune} is foreseen to start as early as 2022. In this period, the team from the \dword{dp} \dword{tpc} electronics consortium, which performed the original R\&D for electronics design since 2006 until 2016, will continuously monitor the market to ensure that all single component parts needed to assemble the electronics cards remain in stock on a timescale of the production of the cards for \dword{dune}. Any elements identified as at risk will be replaced in the executive design with functionally equivalent parts. While this may necessitate some minor design adaptations (e.g., modifying the PCB layout to accommodate a different component footprint), the overall functionality of the system will remain unchanged. Industry survey will also be undertaken for the \dword{fe} \dword{asic} manufacturing process, such that, if a real risk is identified, the \dword{asic} production can be re-qualified for a different production process. The long-term component obsolescence (ID 1) of over the lifetime of the experiment (larger than \num{20} years) will be mitigated by procuring an adequate number of spares at the time of the production.

A strict and timely follow-up of the \dword{fe} requirements from in an event of any possible evolution of \dual \dword{pds} should allow any potential modification of the \dword{lro} \dword{fe} electronics design to be addressed (ID 2).

The \dword{fe} cards should have suitable protection to prevent damage caused by \dword{crp} discharges (ID 3). TVS diodes used in the current design provide sufficient protection for the \dword{fe} electronics in \dword{wa105}. By design, the \dword{fe} cards remain accessible and could be replaced. However, the \dwords{sftchimney} require sufficient overhead clearance (ID 4) so that the blades holding the \dword{fe} cards can be extracted and re-inserted. This should be addressed by imposing an appropriate requirement for \dword{lbnf}.

The \dwords{sftchimney} are equipped with safety valves that vent excess gas if pressure suddenly rises (ID 5). The over-pressure threshold must be set low enough that the flanges suffer no significant damage. The pressure of the nitrogen inside the \dwords{sftchimney} should be monitored to detect potential leaks. In the event of a leak towards the inner volume of the \dword{dpmod} via the cold flange (ID 6), the chimney volume should be filled with argon gas to mitigate the effect nitrogen contamination carries for quenching the scintillation light.  

To ensure the continuous flow of digitized data to \dword{daq} (ID 7), the data rate must stay below the \dword{mch} bandwidth, which is a potential risk if the data compression becomes less efficient because of higher noise. To mitigate this risk, we currently have a margin (a factor of \num{5}) in the available bandwidth: \SI{10}{Gbit/s} \dword{mch} compared to the expected rate of \SI{1.8}{Gbit/s} (Table~\ref{tab:dp-utcabandwidth}).

Potential damage to the \dword{utca} crates due to water condensation on the roof of the cryostat (ID 8) or poor air quality (ID 9) should be mitigated by the \dword{lbnf} requirements that the top of the cryostat remain dry and the air quality similar to any industrial environment (e.g., at CERN or \dword{fermilab}). Large quantities of dust in the detector caverns at SURF should be avoided after the \dword{utca} crates are deployed.
