The design of the \dword{dp} electronics system takes into account several risks, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:risks:DP-FD-TPC}. While the actual design was completed in 2016, the production for the \dword{dpmod} should start as early as 2022. In the interim, the \dword{dp} \dword{tpc} electronics consortium team that performed the original R\&D for the electronics design will continuously monitor the market to ensure that all single component parts needed to assemble the electronics cards remain in stock on the timescale required for production of the cards for \dword{dune}. Any elements identified as at risk will be replaced in the executive design with functionally equivalent parts. While this may necessitate some minor design adaptations (e.g., modifying the \dword{pcb} layout to accommodate a different component footprint), the overall functionality of the system will remain unchanged. An industry survey will also be undertaken for the \dword{fe} \dword{asic} manufacturing process, so if a real risk is identified, the \dword{asic} production can be re-qualified for a different production process. The long-term component obsolescence (RT-DP-TPC-01) over the lifetime of the experiment ($>$ \num{20} years) will be mitigated by procuring an adequate number of spares at the time of production.

A strict and timely reassessment of the \dword{fe} requirements necessitated by any evolution of the \dword{dp} \dword{pds} should allow us to modify the \dword{lro} \dword{fe} electronics design accordingly (RT-DP-TPC-02).

We think the \dword{fe} cards have enough protection to prevent damage caused by \dword{crp} discharges (RT-DP-TPC-03) because the \dword{tvs}  diodes have provided sufficient protection in \dword{wa105}. By design, the \dword{fe} cards remain accessible and could be replaced. However, the \dwords{sftchimney} require sufficient overhead clearance (RT-DP-TPC-04) to extract and re-insert the blades holding the \dword{fe} cards. This is addressed by imposing a clearance requirement on \dword{lbnf}.

The \dwords{sftchimney} are equipped with safety valves that vent excess gas if pressure suddenly rises (RT-DP-TPC-05). The over-pressure threshold must be set low enough that the flanges suffer no significant damage. The pressure of the nitrogen inside the \dwords{sftchimney} must be monitored to detect potential leaks. In the event of a leak via the cold flange (RT-DP-TPC-06), the chimney volume will be filled with argon gas to mitigate the risk of nitrogen contamination quenching the scintillation light.  

To ensure the continuous flow of digitized data to the \dword{daq} (RT-DP-TPC-07), the data rate must stay below the \dword{mch} bandwidth. In the event data compression becomes less efficient because of higher noise, this bandwidth could be exceeded. To mitigate this risk, we currently have a factor of \num{5} margin in the available bandwidth: \SI{10}{Gbit/s} \dword{mch} compared to the expected rate of \SI{1.8}{Gbit/s} (Table~\ref{tab:dp-utcabandwidth}). In addition, the evolution of the technology could lead to the availability of the \SI{40}{Gbit/s} \dword{mch}, which would permit increasing the bandwidth at no over-cost. Such an upgrade would provide enough bandwidth to stream even uncompressed data.


\dword{lbnf} requirements that the top of the cryostat remain dry and the air quality remain comparable to a standard industrial environment (e.g., at \dword{cern} or \dword{fnal}) mitigate the risk of potential damage to the \dword{utca} crates from water condensation (RT-DP-TPC-08) or poor air quality (RT-DP-TPC-09). We must also avoid large quantities of dust in the detector caverns at \dword{surf} after the \dword{utca} crates are deployed.
