\section{Organization and Management}
\label{sec:dp-tpcelec-org}
In this Section we discuss the organization of the \dword{dp} \dword{tpc} electronics consortium responsible for delivering the \dword{cro} and \dword{lro} electronics for \dword{dpmod}. We present the planning assumptions, and give the schedule for production, integration, and installation of the system components. In addition, we provide a detailed breakdown of the core costs for principal sub-components. 

%\fixme{Again, a brief introductory statement here would clarify the logic of the section.}%%%DONE

\subsection{Consortium Organization}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-consortium}
The \dual TPC electronics consortium consists of seven participating institutions from France (\num{3}), Japan (\num{3}), and the USA (\num{1}). Following the structure established within \dword{dune}, the consortium management team consists of a leader (France) and a technical lead (Japan). The consortium presently includes members from APC, IPNL, and LAPP laboratories in France; Iwate University, KEK, and NITKC in Japan; and Southern Methodist University in the USA. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-assmp}
The design of the \dual TPC electronics system relies on elements already developed for \dword{pddp} and tested in the \dword{wa105}.  Commissioning of \dword{pddp} in Summer 2019 should provide some additional information but should not alter the design of principal components. Potential improvements related to the increase in channel density supported by \dwords{amc}  is possible to further reduce costs. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Institutional Responsibilities}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-wbs}
The description of the \dword{wbs}, including the assignments of the responsible institutions is documented in \citedocdb{5594}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{High-level Cost and Schedule}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-cs}
The key schedule milestones are listed in Table~\ref{tab:dp-tpcelec-milestones}. The given dates assume installation of the \dual TPC as the second \dword{fd} \dword{detmodule}.

The detailed cost model for the \dual TPC electronics system has been developed based on scaling the costs for the electronics system of \dword{pddp}. The core costs for producing the electronics system to instrument a single \dword{dpmod} are summarized Table~\ref{tab:dp-tpcelec-costs}.
