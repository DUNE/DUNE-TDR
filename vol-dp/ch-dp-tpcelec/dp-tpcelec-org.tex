\section{Organization and Management}
\label{sec:dp-tpcelec-org}
This section discusses the organization of the \dword{dp} \dword{tpc} electronics consortium responsible for delivering the \dword{cro} and \dword{lro} electronics for \dword{dpmod}. We present the planning assumptions and the schedule for producing, integrating, and installing the system components. In addition, we provide a detailed breakdown of the core costs for principal components.

\subsection{Consortium Organization}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-consortium}

The \dual \dword{tpc} electronics consortium currently includes eight participating institutions (Table~\ref{tab:dp-tpcelec-institutes}): APC, IPNL, LAL, and LAPP laboratories from France, Iwate University, KEK, and NITKC from Japan, and SMU from the  USA. Following the \dword{dune} structure, the consortium management team consists of a leader (France) and a technical lead (Japan).

\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-assmp}
The design of the \dword{dp} \dword{tpc} electronics system relies on elements already developed for \dword{pddp} and tested in the \dword{wa105}.  Commissioning of \dword{pddp} in summer 2019 should provide some additional information but should not alter the design of principal components. Potential improvements related to the increase in channel density supported by the \dwords{amc}  is possible to further reduce costs. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Institutional Responsibilities}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-wbs}
The description of the \dword{wbs}, including the assignments of the responsible institutions, is documented in \citedocdb{5594}.
