The installation and operation of the electronics system does not pose any particular or abnormal safety risks. The handling of the equipment during installation underground should follow the safety protocols established by \dword{uit}. 

In the operation stage, the low voltage power supplies for \dword{fe} cards and \dword{utca} crates are powered from the standard mains system. They do not require any additional protection beyond the ones provided by the power distribution system underground. 

The \dwords{sftchimney} are cooled with liquid argon. In the event of leaks, the cooling circuit of each \dword{sftchimney} is protected by the over-pressure release valve that will vent excess gas from the inner volume.
