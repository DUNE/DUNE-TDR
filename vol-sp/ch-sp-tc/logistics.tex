% orig 2nd draft Transporting equipment and people underground is one of the more challenging aspects of the \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune} endeavor. Access underground goes through the mile long Ross shaft, which is now undergoing renovation. The shaft is outfitted with a single cage for people and materials and two skips that are needed to remove the rock underground. Planning for using the cage is important to making \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune} a success. Given the enormous cost of the \dword{cf} contracts and the large cost of any inefficiencies in construction, the overall coordinator of the Ross Shaft for \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune} will be the \dword{cf} \dword{cmgc}. Both \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} will also have a large number of contractors, institutions, and scientists who will need to bring equipment and materials underground. \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune} will establish a logistics organization in South Dakota near \dword{surf} to facilitate the flow of material and people to the underground area. This organization will be responsible for receiving all goods for \dword{lbnf} (except CF) and \dword{dune},for coordinating the transport of this material underground with the \dword{cf}-\dword{cmgc}, and for coordinating personnel usage of the Ross cage with the \dword{cf}-\dword{cmgc}. 

Transporting equipment and people underground is one of the more challenging aspects of the \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} endeavor. The mile-deep Ross Shaft, currently undergoing renovation, provides access underground. The shaft is outfitted with a hoist that controls a single cage for transporting people and materials and two skips that are used to remove the underground rock. The cage is new.  Given the enormous cost of the \dword{cf} contracts and the large cost of any inefficiencies in construction, scheduling use of the shaft is important to making \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} successful. The  \dword{lbnf} \dword{cf} \dword{cmgc} will be the overall coordinator of the Ross Shaft for \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune}. In addition to  \dword{cmgc} personnel,  many \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} contractors and institutions  will need to bring personnel, equipment and materials underground. \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} will establish a logistics organization and a warehouse  
\fixme{a facility or an organization? \dword{sdwf}? I added warehouse. anne} 
in South Dakota near \dword{surf} to facilitate the flow of people and material to the underground area. This organization will be responsible for (1) receiving all goods for \dword{lbnf} (except \dword{cf}) and \dword{dune}, (2) coordinating the transport of this material underground with the \dword{cf}-\dword{cmgc}, and (3) coordinating use of the Ross shaft with the \dword{cf} \dword{cmgc}.

steel structure for each cryostat requires %bringing 
roughly 1,800 individual steel pieces, % underground, 
some which weigh up to \SI{7.5}{t}, as well as \SI{125}{t} of bolts to assemble the steel pieces. The internal structure, which includes the foam insulation and the thin stainless steel membrane, %will 
requires transporting roughly 4,000 boxes, 
\fixme{per cryostat?} each roughly 1.5 $\times$ 3.5 $\times$ 1.2 m$^3$. The plan for cryostat installation, at present, calls for all components to be warehoused  in South Dakota \fixme{SDWF? be more specific} before installation begins. %This means that t
The logistics operation will  therefore need roughly $\SI{5,000}{m^2}$ of warehouse space approximately two years before installation of the first DUNE \dword{detmodule} begins. By the time DUNE detector components start arriving, most of the cryostat boxes will have been removed from the warehouse, leaving ample space for the detector and cryogenics components. Additional space may be required if the boxes for the second cryostat arrive before  \dword{detmodule} \#1 installation is complete; several buildings of the required size are available in the area around \dword{surf}. % if expansion is required.

%All material brought underground must conform to the \dword{surf} Facility Access Specification \cite{bib:docdb328}. This document defines the limitations on dimensions and weights for all materials to be transported underground.  The most important limitations, which are described in detail in the specification document, relate to the Ross shaft and Ross cage. It is possible to bring material down the shaft underneath the cage as a slung load, but this is a much slower process and requires careful planning, detailed procedures, and review. The \dword{dune} \dword{apa}, for example, requires this special handling because they are too tall to fit in the cage. Most material should be brought underground inside the cage. Figure \ref{fig:fdsp-tc-Cage} shows an image of the new Ross cage and Table \ref{tab:table-Ross-Cage} summarizes its parameters. The round trip travel time for the Ross cage is 17 minutes and this is dominated by loading and unloading time. The time needed to load, lower, and unload any slung load is more than an hour round trip as each step is much longer.

\fixme{sorry, I did not keep the orig pgraph here}

The Ross headframe has no loading dock, so careful coordination is required. All materials transported to it must arrive on a flatbed or curtain-sided chassis, where a forklift can unload  the items. The logistics team coordinates all deliveries to the headframe, and the \dword{cf}-\dword{cmgc} coordinates all transport from there down the shaft.  Most material will be delivered first to the \dword{sdwf}, where a central inventory system will capture data about the shipments.  All deliveries, either from this warehouse or direct to the Ross headframe, require (1) coordination with the logistics team, and (2) minimum two weeks prior notice, per an advance delivery plan \fixme{ref}.  The logistics team will provide a shipping manual \fixme{ref} to \dword{dune} institutions. The institutions must provide shipping data and consign cargo according to the guidelines so that the logistics team can monitor progress. 



In \dword{protodune}-\dword{sp}, delays in shipping and customs resulted in up to three weeks delay in the arrival of some parts, which necessitated significant re-planning of the installation work. To prevent this from becoming a much larger problem in \dword{dune}, we plan a minimum one month buffer of materials. This buffer will allow advance planning for the underground work, %can be planned well in advance, knowing 
with confidence that all materials will be available as needed. %This will require that sufficient space be available in the warehouse and underground at \dword{surf} to house the material buffer. Many small parcels will arrive at the warehouse from different sources.

To discover how much space is needed for storage and how much hoist time must be dedicated to \dword{dune}, a detailed inventory of all detector equipment and \dword{dune} infrastructure is needed. The list of %all the 
materials has been solicited from all consortia and technical coordination. The entries in the inventory spreadsheet are organized as ``loads'' for the Ross shaft where a load is a crate or set of boxes that will be transported underground in one trip, either in the %hoist
cage or as a slung load~\cite{bib:docdb8426}. 
Information captured in the load spreadsheet includes the number of %hoist 
trips, type of trip (slung load or cage), package dimensions, weight and type of package (crate, pallet, box, or carton). 

The load list at present predicts 1,600 hoist trips and approximately two  months of cage time, most of which is spread over one year. Installation %operation 
(see Figure \ref{fig:high-level-schedule}) for the \dword{spmod} %detector 
will span two years, so we divide the logistics planning into three  %several 
phases: % is prudent.  The load information is divided into 
(1) the \dword{cuc} setup phase, (2) the installation setup phase, and (3) the detector installation phase. For each phase, a model was generated to show how much material can be stored underground outside the work area and how much material must be stored on the surface. These models set the space requirements for the logistics on the surface. The phase with the largest amount of material to transport is the detector setup phase. \fixme{not defined, detector installation?}  Figure \ref{fig:fdsp-tc-setup} shows the model of the underground area and the required boxes for surface storage for the first third of the setup. This represents the first month of installation setup and shows that roughly 1,000 m$^2$\ of warehouse space will be needed for \dword{dune} at this time.  The %warehouse 
\dword{sdwf} will also need space to store up to 150 \dwords{apa}, %in addition to the space needed to receive and ship equipment underground. This

%\subsection{Logistics Quality Assurance and Quality Control}
\subsection{Logistics Quality Control}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-log-qaqc}


%\dword{protodune} was an extremely useful exercise in general, but we can draw only a few conclusions about \dword{dune} logistics %because 
%since shipping to Europe differs from shipping to South Dakota and different staff will be responsible for receiving and transport. %the CERN receiving and transport divisions will not be used for \dword{dune}. 
The \dword{protodune} experience offers a couple of significant lessons regarding logistics.

%The full list of %lessons learned is found in the 
%ProtoDUNE-SP lessons learned is in~\cite{bib:docdb8255}. %spreadsheets. 
%The most important lessons learned from \dword{protodune} logistics are: % listed below.
\begin{enumerate}
%\item Lack of a central inventory system made it impossible to track shipments.
%\item Delays in shipping meant that the installation work could not be planned and parts were installed as they arrived. 
\item A central inventory system is essential for tracking  shipments.
\item It is important to avoid delays in shipping because installation work cannot proceed as planned. 
\end{enumerate}

%To address these issues, a central inventory system will be implemented at the logistics warehouse facility, and a minimum one month material buffer will be required from the consortia in South Dakota.
The central inventory system  implemented at the \dword{sdwf}  and the minimum one month material buffer are the plans we have in place to prevent repetition of the problems we experienced with \dword{pdsp}.   The full list of lessons learned from \dword{pdsp} is in~\cite{bib:docdb8255}. 

We do not foresee any component testing at the \dword{sdwf}, %in the warehouse, 
so the scope of the \dword{qc} work there is limited to two functions. %A \dword{qa}/\dword{qc} component, however, will be required at receiving. 
%However, a critical \dword{qc} check there %at the logistics facility 
%will 
The facility will ensure that all materials to be shipped to the Ross headframe will fit in the cage, or %. Moreover, 
if a slung load is needed, %the facility will confirm 
that the necessary procedures are in place and approved before any material is transported. % to \dword{surf}. 
It will also %The other primary \dword{qc} function performed at the logistics facility is to 
inventory all received shipments. % described below.

%The contribution in kind model of this project makes logistics and inventory control as well as gathering of the relevant construction data extremely complex. Therefore, the logistics (inventory) control and collection of scientific data  must be controlled by independent systems. 
%The logistics supply chain will be controlled by the contributors' freight forwarding system until supplies arrive at the \dword{sdwf}, which has yet to be defined/established.  \dword{sdwf} will be the ultimate point of capture for all \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune} parts/equipment except possibly for the cryogenic system, given the contractual requirements. The inventory process at the \dword{sdwf}, the \dword{itf} and the \dword{surf} receiving at Ross Shaft will be controlled by one \dword{wms}. 

The contribution-in-kind model of this project complicates logistics and inventory control and the gathering of the relevant construction data. Therefore, the inventory control and the collection of scientific data 
\fixme{scientific data? is this testing data?} must be controlled by independent systems. 
Until materials arrive at the \dword{sdwf}, the \dword{itf}, or \dword{surf} (if directly shipped), the contributors' freight forwarding system will control the logistics supply chain, which has yet to be defined.  \dword{sdwf} will be the ultimate point of capture for all the materials except possibly for the cryogenics system, given its special contractual requirements. A central \dword{wms} will control the inventory process at the \dword{sdwf}, the \dword{itf} and the \dword{surf} receiving at the Ross headframe.
