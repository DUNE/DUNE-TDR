\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-infr-intro}

The infrastructure needed to install the \dword{fd} includes the \dword{dss}, the electronics mezzanine on the cryostat roof (including racks), cable trays, underground cleanroom with related installation equipment, piping inside the cryostat, and coldboxes. 
 The major infrastructure provided by the installation group is described below. 
 Separate sub-sections are included for the \dword{dss}, the cryostat roof infrastructure, cryostat internal infrastructure, cleanroom, and cryogenics and cold-boxes.

In addition to the equipment described below, many other items will be needed: a small machine shop, scissor lifts, rigging equipment, hand tools, diagnostic equipment (including oscilloscopes, network analyzers, and leak detectors), local storage with some critical supplies and \dword{ppe}.  

\fixme{This section (titled introduction) can have the heading removed so the introductory text follows the major heading (Infrastructure). I'd do it for you, but I haven't got that figured out yet.}

\subsection{Cryostat Roof Infrastructure}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-infr-cryo-roof}



\begin{dunefigure}[Mezzanine and electronics racks]{fig:mezzanine}
  {The electronics racks sit on the DUNE electronics mezzanine as shown. The top image is a view from above the detector looking at the racks from the side.

 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mezzanine.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

\begin{dunefigure}[Electronics rack contents]{fig:rack-build1}
  {The nominal contents of the electronics racks on the mezzanine is shown. Each rack is configured to consume less than 3.5 \si{kW}. }
 \includegraphics[width=.98\textwidth]{graphics/rack-build1.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

The top image in Figure \ref{fig:mezzanine} shows the \dword{dune} electronics mezzanine with the 42U racks placed on top. 
During the initial design steps, it became clear that the constraints placed on the rack location by the many \dword{dss} support feedthroughs, the electronics feedthrough, and the I-beams themselves make distributing the racks on the roof very challenging. 
By constructing a fixed mezzanine above the cryostat at the same height as the cryogenic mezzanine, the electronics feedthroughs are kept clear. 
This configuration also makes working on the electronics much easier because there are no local obstacles and all the racks are in one place.

The racks are on detector ground so the mezzanine is also on detector ground where it can simply be bolted to the cryostat I-beams. 
As Figure \ref{fig:mezzanine} shows, 16 groups of five racks each are on the mezzanine for a total of 80 racks. 
The heat load inside the detector racks should dissipate through air flow generated by cooling fans.  The major heat load resides with the cold electronics and photon electronics located near the cryostat feedthroughs.  If rack mounted fans do not provide sufficient cooling,  \dword{cf} will provide sufficient water cooling capacity at the entrance to the North cavern to accommodate the maximum heat load. 

Twenty-five racks will be needed for cold electronics low voltage power and twenty-five racks are available for \dword{apa} wire bias voltage, \dword{pd} power and miscellaneous. \fixme{Miscellaneous what?}
The remaining 25 racks will be available for slow control, calibration, and other miscellaneous equipment. 
Small racks will also be placed near the electronics feedthroughs for the \dword{pd} readout electronics and optical patch panels. 
If this is not enough, then additional racks can be placed on the cryostat roof. 
The present rack build for this layout is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rack-build1}. The modules inside the racks are distributed to keep power consumption for each rack below 3.5 \si{kW}.
The racks to be installed will be 42U high, so we may need significant extra capacity.  If added electronics are needed for the \dword{ce}, however, we would need to install the modules in a \dword{pd} rack to stay under the power limit per rack.

The 12U high mini-racks near the feedthrough flanges will be relatively empty because the \dword{pd} readout should need only approximately 2U in height while the \dword{ce} patch panel needs less than 1 U. The mini-racks are shown in the lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:rack-build1}; they are the gray rectangles near the electronics tees.

The north-south cable trays running from the electronics mezzanine to the electronics feedthrough will be routed under the floor of the cryostat roof next to the cryostat I-beams. 
Doing this will keep the roof reasonably clear, so equipment can be transported across the cryostat roof as needed. 
The gap between the web of the I-beams is 1.2 \si{m}, so a 200-300 \si{mm} wide cable tray can be installed while still leaving enough space to stand on the roof and work on the electronics crates. 
The cable trays between the \dword{cuc} and the electronics mezzanine will run along the West end of the cryostat under the floor. 
We estimatet only 1/2 of the 1.6 \si{m} space is needed, so the cable tray quantity could in principal be doubled if necessary. 

The flooring should be similar to the 25 \si{mm} thick plywood used at \dword{protodune}; it will be used for the final \dword{dune} detector. 
The flooring material must be easy to cut because it must fit around many obstacles and pipes on the roof, it must be light enough to lift up for access below, and it must support the load of a person or small cart. 
We will investigate what type fire retardant options exist in the US and will solicit input from the \dword{fnal} fire life-safety group. 

Air filters for the cleanroom and inside the cryostat will also be placed on the cryostat roof. The present plan is to place fan filter units near the manholes on the East end of the cryostat. Initial calculations indicate sufficient airflow is possible to support one air exchange per hour inside the cryostat. The air handling system has yet to be designed in detail.


\begin{dunefigure}[Cryostat crossing tube design]{fig:crossingtube}
  {Draft drawing of the cryostat crossing tubes. The hatched region is the cryostat insulation.}
\includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{crossingtube}
\end{dunefigure}

The cryostat crossing tubes are among the most critical components of the roof infrastructure. These are the vacuum components that penetrate the cryostat roof and connect to the cold cryostat membrane. The top flange of the crossing tube supports the electronics feedthrough or the detector support flanges and must be directly tied to the steel I-beams for support. Accurately placing the crossing tubes and installing them true to vertical is important, ensuring the interface to the cryostat membrane can be made. A draft assembly drawing of the crossing tube is shown in Figure \ref{fig:crossingtube}. The tube consists of a 464 \si{mm} long stainless steel pipe with 1 \si{cm} wall. The thin stainless steel tube is welded to the cryostat membrane at one end of the tube and custom CF \fixme{This abbreviation is in the common glossary, but I don't think it works here. CF = conventional facilities in the common glossary. Go ahead and spell this one out.} flanges are welded to the other end. The \si{cm} thick tube is welded to the steel roof plates.


To ensure that the crossing tubes are adequately cleaned during the initial GAr \fixme{This abbreviation is defined in the next section. It should be defined the first time it is used, if it needs a definition at all. I suspect it does not.} purge and that air is removed from the tubes, each crossing tube has a small side port connected to a network of pipes on the roof of the cryostat. During the initial GAr purge, argon gas is withdrawn from each port and analyzed to assess progress and determine when the system is ready to be cooled down. The large number of crossing tubes, about 250 in the \dword{sp} configuration, means the content from each port cannot be analyzed independently of all others. Five streams, each one collecting gas from about 50 crossing tubes are connected independently to the gas analyzers. Gas impurities accumulate in the ullage. During steady state operations, GAr from the crossing tubes will be analyzed to ensure that impurities are adequately removed from the GAr.    If additional cleaning of the ullage is necessary, the GAr withdrawn from all ports, or a smaller set of them, can be sent to the condenser, re-condensed, and purified in the liquid phase along with the rest of the \dword{lar}. To detect any possible leaks that could develop in the room temperature feedthroughs over time, simple O$^2$\ sensors monitor the return gas for traces of oxygen, which would indicate a leak.

Each detector has a power budget of 500 KVA. The total power budget available for use by detector electronics is derated to 400KW at the power distribution panels.  The \dword{ce} are the largest power load.  

The \dword{ce} dissipate 306 Watts per \dword{apa}.  The low voltage power supplies have a controller that is about 35 Watts per \dword{apa} and has an efficiency of approximately 85 percent.  This leads to approximately 400 Watts per \dword{apa}, or a total load of 60 KW per detector.  The \dword{apa} wire bias power supplies have a maximum load of 465 Watts per six \dword{apa}s for a total budget of around 12 KW.  Some nominal amount of power will be used by cooling fans and heaters near the feedthroughs, so the overall power budget for \dword{ce} should be less than 75 KW.

The photon detector electronics based on the Mu2e electronics report a power load of approximately 6KW.  A power budget of 8KW should be used because of cable drops and  power supply inefficiencies.  Please note that these \dword{pd} electronics are a significantly lower power load than the alternate \dword{protodune} solution of using \dword{ssp} modules at a power load of approximately 72 KW per detector.

Each of the approximately 80 detector racks will have fan units, ethernet switches, rack protection, and slow controls modules adding a load of about 500 Watts per rack, for a total of 40 KW.

A number of racks are reserved for cryo instrumentation.  The load of these 25 racks is conservatively estimated at 2 KW per rack for a total of 50 KW.

Thus, an estimated 173 KW of power will be used by the detector.  If the \dword{pd} finds it must go to a higher load \dword{ssp} solution, we can expect a total of 237 KW.  These numbers provide a safety factor of about two on our power estimates when compared to available power.

\subsection{Cryostat Internal Infrastructure}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-infr-cryo-int}

\fixme{Check text from David below!!}

\input{vol-sp/ch-sp-tc/internalcryo}

Other infrastructure inside the cryostat includes the cryostat false floor, the UV filtered lighting, and the battery operated scissor lifts. The false floor is not yet designed because the requirements are not yet fully defined. The false floor must support the load of the scissor lift used to work on the electronic cabling on the cryostat roof inside. It must be laid out so the panels can be removed in sections just before the equipment is installed. The space between the lowest point of the \dword{apa} modules and the floor is too small to allow the flooring to be removed after the \dword{apa} is in place. However, the floor panels in front of the \dword{apa} must allow the scissor lift to get close enough to the \dword{apa} to work comfortably at the top. Careful layout will be needed. 

The cryostat lighting, using UV filtered LED lamps, is expected to be fairly simple. Options for the lighting will be developed during the Ash River testing. Floor mounted lights with task lighting will be investigated. If needed, lighting can also be mounted to the \dword{dss} and removed as the detector is installed.

The scissor lift is a commercially available battery operated scissor lift with a 12 \si{m} reach. Tests at Ash River will verify the stability of the lift at the 12 \si{m} height. If the lift is determined to be suitable, then the remaining issue to resolve is how to install and remove the lift from the cryostat. The commercially available scissor lifts are too wide to fit through the \dword{tco} near the floor where the center post protrudes above floor level. Custom lifting equipment will be needed to insert the lifts into the cryostat. At the end of the installation process, dismantling the last lift may be necessary to remove it from the cryostat.

\subsection{Cleanroom Infrastructure}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-infr-comm}

\begin{dunefigure}[Installation Cleanroom layout]{fig:cleanroom-layout}
  {Two views of the installation cleanroom. The walls are semi-transparent so the equipment inside can be seen. The first view from the West looking East shows the materials airlock (orange outline) and changing room (yellow outline). The second image looking North shows the outline of the cleanroom in green where the cryostat is on the right and the airlocks on the right.} \fixme{Are both the cryostat and the airlocks on the right?}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{cleanroom-layout}
\end{dunefigure}

The assembly of the detector sub-components into 12 \si{m} tall full modules must be done underground directly outside the cryostat. The 12 \si{m} long assemblies are too large and fragile to be brought down the shaft, and the only place with enough vertical space to assemble them is in front of the cryostat itself. A combination of contractors and the lead worker and rigger teams will do the infrastructure work; they will also assist in detector assembly. The cleanliness requirement for all work on the components inside the detector means that all work must be done in an ISO-8 cleanroom, so a very large cleanroom must be built outside the cryostat containing all the necessary infrastructure to assemble the detector \dword{tpc} elements. Figure \ref{fig:cleanroom-layout} provides an image of the conceptual design of the installation cleanroom. The left figure is an end view of the cleanroom, showing the materials airlock and the changing room. 

The plan is to bring all detector elements into the cleanroom through large roll up doors in the side wall of the airlock. The materials will be moved using using  a battery operated forklift and electric pallet jacks. The airlock will be  13 \si{m} wide 10 \si{m} deep and 17 \si{m} tall. This is large enough to hold the \dword{apa} assembly tower described below with enough extra space to move large objects inside. An access hatch is planned for the roof, allowing the cavern bridge crane to be used in the central area of the airlock. The crane is needed to manipulate the \dword{apa} modules in the airlock; the plan calls for assembly of the double high \dword{apa} pairs there. Also shown on the right of the figure is the changing room for the cleanroom. The changing room is 3 \si{m} wide and 10 \si{m} deep. The dimensions were chosen to allow 20-30 people to gown up for the cleanroom within a reasonable time. The requirements for an ISO-8 cleanroom are a cleanroom lab coat, clean shoes, and hair/beard net. This will be augmented with a clean hard hat and gloves for safety reasons. 

The outline of the cleanroom proper is shown on the right in Figure \ref{fig:cleanroom-layout}. The cleanroom dimensions are 16 \si{m} wide 10 \si{m} deep and 17 \si{m} tall. The cleanroom lies primarily under the North-South bridge and in the 3.4m space between the bridge and the cryostat. Here operations that must be performed are the cabling of the \dword{apa}, cold testing of the \dword{apa}, and assembly of the cathode \dword{fc} modules. The tower for the \dword{apa} cabling, the cold boxes for testing, and the switchyard for moving the 12m tall objects are described below. All areas of the airlock and cleanroom will be outfitted with UV filtered lights. In addition to this cleanroom, the inside of the cryostat will also be effectively a cleanroom.  By filtering the air and forcing it  into the cryostat at the East end, the clean air will flow through the cryostat and out through the cleanroom and airlock. This will keep the inside of the cryostat at least at ISO-8. The construction process for the cleanroom is still at the conceptual, level so what is shown is a steel frame structure where panels can be mounted. The size is substantial and the occupancy significant, so the cleanroom should have electrical outlets, UV filtered lighting, and fire protection. 

\fixme{need to check all dimensions and update the figure}

\begin{dunefigure}[APA assembly tower]{fig:apa-assemble-frame}
  {Image of the \dword{apa} assembly tower with the \dword{apa} assembly frame attached. The transport rails at the top of the figure are used to move the assembled \dword{apa} into the cleanroom. The work decks allow access to the \dword{apa} from multiple levels. }
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{apa-assemble-frame}
\end{dunefigure}
\fixme{need to update the figure}

The \dword{apa} assembly tower is a 6 story tall stair tower used to assemble the individual \dword{apa} modules into the final 12 \si{m} tall pair. 
The tower is designed to so that the stair landings will allow access to the sides and top of the \dword{apa} as required for assembly. 
The APA assembly tower also provides support for the the \dword{apa} assembly fixture provided by the \dword{apa} consortia. 
The \dword{apa} assembly fixture is the tooling needed to hold the upper and lower \dword{apa} during assembly and to bring the two modules together so they can be connected. 

Figure \ref{fig:apa-assemble-frame} shows an image of the \dword{apa} assembly tower. 
In this figure, the \dword{apa} assembly frame is shown mounted on the assembly tower, and an \dword{apa} transport box is on the airlock floor in front of the tower. 
At the top of the \dword{apa} assembly tower is a set of I-beam rails used to move the \dword{apa} pair into the cleanroom through a sliding door shown in brown. 
The final trolleys will be used from this step forward. 
Care will be taken in the \dword{apa} assembly steps to remove only a minimal amount of the dust protection from the \dword{apa} because manipulating the \dword{apa} must be performed using the cavern bridge crane, which will require an opening in the roof. 
Once the \dword{apa}s are assembled, the bridge crane is no longer needed, and the roof opening is closed. Air is then circulated until the required purity is met. The tower shown in Figure \ref{fig:apa-assemble-frame} has landings that will meet safety codes, but the outer steel frame to support the landings has not yet been designed.


\begin{dunefigure}[APA cabling tower]{fig:apa-cable-tower}
  {Image of the \dword{apa} cabling tower. The two reels of cable for the electronics are shown. The work decks allow access to the \dword{apa} from multiple levels. }
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{apa-cable-tower}
\end{dunefigure}

Inside the cleanroom is another stair tower used for cabling and the initial tests of the \dword{ce}. The time required for cabling and testing of the electronics in \dword{protodune} show that two workstations are needed. The \dword{apa} cabling tower is shown in Figure \ref{fig:apa-cable-tower}. The \dword{apa} cabling tower is a stair tower similar to the \dword{apa} assembly tower where access is provided to the sides of the \dword{apa} at many levels, and a dedicated lift provides access on the outer face. The cable is brought up to the top of the platform on spools using the switchyard described below. The \dword{apa}s are moved next to the stair tower work faces using the switchyard.  Sufficient space is needed at the top levels to allow people to work on the cabling and test the electronics. The size and the layout of the top level of the tower will be optimized based on input from prototyping tests to be done at Ash River. 

\begin{dunefigure}[Cleanroom material transport system]{fig:cleanroom-switchyard}
  {The switchyard inside the cleanroom and airlock is shown. In this figure, the beams of the switchyard are highlighted in red. Fixed beams running East-West are used to move the APA and CPA to a dedicated work location while a bridge crane running North-South is used to transport the units between the different fixed beams. }
\includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{cleanroom-switchyard}
\end{dunefigure}

Once the \dword{apa} pair or the \dword{cpa} panels are assembled, the units will be moved around the cleanroom and airlock using a dedicated rail based switchyard (I-beam and trolley). An image of the switchyard is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cleanroom-switchyard}. In the center of the figure is the bridge crane which travels North-South. Several bridge beams driven by electric trolleys will move on the runway beams of the crane.  By aligning the bridge beams with a set of fixed beams supported from the cleanroom roof the \dword{apa} and \dword{cpa} can be transferred from the fixed beams to the bridge crane and then moved to different locations in the cleanroom. Figure \ref{fig:cleanroom-switchyard} shows a single fixed beam in front of the \dword{apa} assembly tower in the airlock and seven locations on the right where equipment can be moved during assembly and testing. The work stations are on the two faces of the \dword{apa} cabling tower, the two beams through the \dword{tco} used to move the finished detector into the cryostat, and the three I-beams used to move the \dword{apa} into the cold boxes in the North-East corner of the cleanroom. An additional fixed beam must be added over the cabling tower to allow the cable reels to be hoisted to the top. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cryogenics and Cold-Boxes}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-infr-cryo}
After the \dword{apa} pairs are fully assembled and cabled, they are thermally cycled before being installed in the cryostat. To do this, three tall but narrow cryostats are needed that can be cooled as close to LAr temperature as reasonably possible. These cryostats are referred to as cold-boxes and require a dedicated cryogenics system. 



The cold-boxes used to thermally cycle the assembled \dword{apa} pairs before they are installed in the cryostat are shown in Figure \ref{fig:install-coldbox}. 
To test \dword{apa}s at a rate necessary to keep up with the installation plan, three cold-boxes are needed inside the cleanroom. 
Each cold-box has external dimensions of 14.0 \si{m} by 3.2 \si{m} by 1.3 \si{m} (H $\times$ L $\times$ W). 
Three layers of 100 \si{mm} thick foam insulation are used for the thermal isolation. 
This gives an internal dimensions of 13.4 \si{m} x 2.6 \si{m} x 0.7 \si{m} (H $\times$ L $\times$ W). 
Inside each cold-box, a rail section similar to the ones used in the \dword{tco} as well as other fixed rails in the cleanroom will be mounted.
This will allow the \dword{apa} to be pushed into the cold-boxes using the cleanroom switchyard and trolleys. 
A support base will be needed under the cold-boxes to adjust the height to mate with the cleanroom switchyard.

The cold-boxes will have an electronics feedthrough similar to what is used on the top of the \dword{dune} cryostat, other than short cables that will be run from the WEC \fixme{This abbreviation is not in the common glossary.} to a patch panel inside the cold-box.
This will allow the cable on the \dword{apa} to be connected directly to the test readout without having to remove any cabling. 
Each cold-box will be designed like the successful \dword{protodune}-\dword{sp} cold-box. 
The outer shell is constructed of a stainless steel plate with reinforcing ribs welded on. 
The biggest difference between the 
dw
dunecold-boxes and the \dword{protodune}-\dword{sp} cold-box, other than doubling the height, is that a hinged door is planned for the \dword{dune} cold-boxes. 
In \dword{protodune}, unbolting the door and lifting it off the coldbox required significant effort. 
In \dword{dune}, the cleanroom does not have full crane coverage, so doors that can be opened and closed using a scissor lift are necessary.
Initial estimates are that the \dword{dune} cold-boxes will need about 11 \si{T} of stainless steel. 
They must be assembled in place because the finished boxes are too big to fit down the Ross Shaft. 
The cold-box base must be on Hilman rollers, so the boxes can be moved under the bridge after installation to allow installation of the cryogenic circulation pumps.

\subsection{Prototyping and Testing (QA/QC)}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-infr-qaqc}
This is the critical phase where all of new equipment is installed underground.  While most of these installation procedures have already been tested during the trial assembly at Ash River, everything must be properly approved. The main \dword{apa} and \dword{cpa} towers will already be structurally approved, but load tests must be performed on all lifting fixtures, shuttle beams, crane tower connections, and cold-box connections. 

This is also when the cold-boxes and cryogenic system will be tested, so access to the cleanroom will be necessary on many days, and access to the cleanroom may be restricted for system checks.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Safety}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-infr-safety}
At this phase of construction of Detector 1, larger teams from the consortia, SDSD,  and contractors will need access to underground facilities at the same time \dword{lbnf} is completing the cold structure on Detector 1 and beginning the warm structure on Detector 2. Shift schedules now switch to 2 shifts/day because a maximum of 140 \dword{fte} can be underground at any given time.  Daily work meetings and safety coordination led by the shift supervisor at the start of each shift to coordinate work activities, hazard/mitigation reviews, and installation procedures are critical for a safe work environment. More details can be found in section 1.4.4 under the Installation \dword{esh} section. 

The \dword{uit} will be extremely busy at this time. The crew sizes are increasing, so training new employees and consortia will be ongoing, and new equipment is being installed and tested. Proper documentation of structural calculations, assembly drawings, load tests, hazard analyses, and procedures will all have to be reviewed and approved before operational readiness is approved. This all helps prepare for a safe start to the underground installation. 

The cold-box and cryogenic system is one of the few things in the installation process that will not be fully tested during any of the trial assembly work. While the design of the boxes are very similar to the what was done at CERN for \dword{protodune}, the major difference is the system requirement that it is safe for workers to be in the cleanroom during the cool down phase. Procedures for operating the cold box have not been defined, but a requirements document has been written.   

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Costs, Schedule, and Risk Analysis}
\label{sec:fdsp-tc-infr-cost}

\fixme{Add costs when available}

{\bf Installation Setup Phase:} This is a more difficult phase to schedule and may be adjusted often with multiple projects going forward at once. The \dword{cf} work is basically completed, which reduces the number of \dwords{fte} underground, allowing us to begin the installation infrastructure. We begin two 10 hour shifts per day as the work ramps up.  Once the cold cryostat is approximately six months into the installation schedule, floor space becomes available in the North Cavern. The cold-box construction must be started ASAP because the welding takes approximately six months. In parallel to this, the work on the shop area and the bridge between the North and South sides of the cavern can be constructed. \fixme{Check the previous sentence please. It was not clear, so I'm not sure of the meaning.} Once the bridge is completed, work on the assembly crane, \dword{apa} cabling tower, \dword{apa} assembly tower, and \dword{cpa} assembly station can begin. 
    
Installation of the detector support system could begin during the final installation stages of the cryostat cold structure because they both require full height scaffolding for all the welding on the top of the cryostat. This was how the \dword{protodune} \dword{dss} was installed. The details have not yet been worked out with the contractor, so work may be done in stages. This requires a crew on top of the cryostat installing the \dword{dss} support feethroughs from the top of the cryostat as shown in Figure 1.25. \fixme{This should be labeled using the proper coding.}

A detailed schedule of the installation infrastructure time period is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Installation_Infrastructure_Schedule}.
