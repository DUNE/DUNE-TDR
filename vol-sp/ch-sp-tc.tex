% orig 2nd draft
%This \dword{dune} detector installation chapter covers all the work and infrastructure needed in South Dakota to install the single-phase detector.  The following chapter is divided into dedicated sections describing the major divisions of work.  The first section is the logistics section that describes how material will be delivered to the South Dakota region and then forwarded to the Ross shaft for transport underground or the  \dword{itf} where \dword{apa}-\dword{pd}-\dword{ce} are assembled together.  The second section covers the integration test facility.  Here the work performed in the \dword{itf} is described, the \dword{itf} infrastructure requirements are presented and the tests performed during the integration process are explained. The next section is covers the infrastructure needed underground for the detector.  The final section describes the installation process itself.  The specifications for the installation are listed in Table \ref{tab:specs:just:SP-TC}.

This  chapter covers all the work and infrastructure required to install the \dword{spmod}.  It is divided into dedicated sections describing the major divisions of work.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tc-log} describes how material will be delivered to the South Dakota region and then forwarded  either  directly to the Ross Headframe on the \dword{surf} site for transport underground, or to a nearby logistics warehouse for storage or repackaging. 
\item Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tc-infr} infrastructure section describes the infrastructure need6++=8=89/63-ed underground for the detector module installation.
\item Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tc-inst} describes the actual underground installation process. 
\end{itemize}
 The specifications for the integration and installation activities are listed in Table~\ref{tab:specs:just:SP-TC}.
