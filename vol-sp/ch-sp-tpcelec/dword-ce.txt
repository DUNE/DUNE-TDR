sp-tpcelec-design.tex:The analog \dword{fe} \dword{asic}~\cite{DeGeronimo:2011zz} receives current signals from the \dword{tpc} sense wires and provides a way to amplify and shape the signals for downstream signal digitization.  The \dword{fe} \dword{asic} has 16 channels and is implemented using the TSMC 180nm CMOS process. It integrates a band-gap reference (BGR) \fixme{This abbreviation is not in the glossary.} to generate all the internal bias voltages and currents. This guarantees high stability of the operating point over a wide range of temperatures, including cryogenic temperatures. The channel schematic of the \dword{fe} \dword{asic} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:feasic1}. 
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:Each \dword{fe} \dword{asic} channel has a dual-stage charge amplifier and a 5$^{th}$ order semi-Gaussian shaper as an anti-aliasing filter for the \dword{tpc} signals. It has a programmable gain selectable from one of 4.7, 7.8, 14, or 25mV/fC (corresponding to full-scale charge of 300, 180, 100, and 55 fC), a programmable peaking time selectable from one of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 $\mu$s, and a programmable baseline for operation with either the collection ($\sim$200mV) or the induction ($\sim$900mV) wires. Each channel has an option to enable the output monitor to probe the analog signal, and an option to enable a high-performance output driver that can be used to drive a long cable. 
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:Each \dword{fe} \dword{asic} channel has a built-in charge calibration capacitor that can be enabled or disabled through a dedicated register. The injection capacitance has been measured using a calibrated external capacitor. The measurements show that the calibration capacitance is extremely stable, changing from 184 fF at room temperature to 183 fF at 77 K. This result and the measured stability of the peaking time demonstrate the high stability of the passive components as a function of temperature. Channel-to-channel and chip-to-chip variation in the calibration capacitor are typically less than 1\%.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:Shared among the 16 channels in the \dword{fe} \dword{asic} are the digital interface, programming registers, a temperature monitor, and a band-gap reference monitor. We also can enable AC coupling as mitigation of microphonics, a programmable bias current selectable from one of 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 5nA, as well as a programmable pulser generator with 6-bit \dword{dac} for calibration. 
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:The power dissipation of \dword{fe} \dword{asic} is about 5.5mW per channel at 1.8V supply voltage with output buffer disabled. The \dword{asic} is packaged in a commercial, fully encapsulated plastic QFP 80 package. Figure~\ref{fig:feasic2} shows the response of \dword{fe} \dword{asic} for all gains and peaking times and both baselines. Note that the gain is independent of the peaking time; the same amount of charge produces the same peak voltage signal regardless of the peaking time.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:Prototype version P2 \dword{fe} \dwords{asic} have been evaluated and characterized at room temperature and LN$_2$ (77 K) temperature. 960 P2 \dword{fe} \dwords{asic}, totaling 15,360 channels, have been used to instrument six \dword{protodunesp} \dword{apa}s successfully. Excessive stress of package of \dword{fe} \dword{asic} in cryogenic temperature means \dword{fe} channels have a non-uniform baseline in collection mode, while the baseline DC voltage in induction mode is uniform. A new prototype, version P3, was fabricated in March 2018 to address this issue by making DC circuits for collection mode similar to the induction mode. At the same time, the default gain setting changed to 14mV/fC. The layout of P3 \dword{fe} \dword{asic} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:feasic2}, with modifications highlighted in yellow boxes. The P3 \dword{fe} \dwords{asic} were received and evaluated in September 2018, and both baseline in collection mode and default gain setting are working properly.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:P3 \dword{fe} \dword{asic} will be further evaluated on \dwords{femb} in various integration test stands for performance studies, including 40\% \dword{apa} at BNL, \dword{iceberg} \dword{tpc} at \dword{fermilab} and \dword{apa}7 at CERN. Test results of P3 \dword{fe} \dword{asic} will guide the development of the next version P4 \dword{fe} \dword{asic}, which will be implemented single ended to differential (SE-DIFF) converter for interface to recently developed \dword{adc} \dword{asic}. During \dword{protodunesp} operation, it was observed that the \dword{fe} \dwords{asic} may enter into a saturation mode when large amounts of charge ($>$ 50fC) collect in 10-50$\mu$s. This is being studied in the laboratory test stand, with the plan to address it in the P4 \dword{fe} \dword{asic} revision as well.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:\dword{coldadc} is a low-noise 12-bit \dword{adc} \dword{asic} designed to digitize 16 input channels at a rate of \SI{{\sim}2}{MHz}.  \dword{coldadc} accepts either single-ended or differential inputs and outputs digitized data to \dword{coldata}.  \dword{coldadc} is implemented in TSMC 65 nm \dword{cmos} technology and was designed by a team of engineers from \dword{lbl}, BNL, and \dword{fermilab}.  The \dword{asic} uses a conservative, industry standard design including digital calibration.  Each \dword{coldadc} receives 16 voltage outputs from a single \dword{larasic} chip.  The voltages are buffered, multiplexed by 8, and input to two 15-stage pipelined \dwords{adc} operating at 16 MS/s.  The \dword{adc} uses the well-known pipelined architecture with redundancy~\cite{PipelinedADC, CalibrationCorrection}.  Digital logic is used to correct non-linearity introduced by non-ideal amplifier gain and comparator thresholds in each pipeline stage, and an automatic calibration procedure is implemented to determine the constants used in this logic.  To maximize the probability that the first prototype \dword{coldadc} will perform well, the chip is highly programmable, and many circuit blocks can be bypassed.  A block diagram of the chip is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:coldadc-blockdiagram}.  Each of the major blocks is described below.  \dword{coldadc} uses two bias voltages; 2.25V for I/O and 1.1V for the balance of the \dword{asic}.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:All required reference voltages and currents are generated on-chip by programmable circuit blocks.  The most accurate reference voltage circuit is a band-gap reference based on a PNP (bipolar) transistor.  However, the TSMC 65 nm \dword{cmos} process does not allow fabrication of high performance bipolar transistors, and bipolar transistors perform less well at liquid argon temperature than at room temperature.  Thus, a \dword{cmos}-based voltage reference has also been included in \dword{coldadc}.  If both on-chip reference generation circuits fail, an external voltage reference can be used.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:Many of the functional blocks in \dword{coldadc} are biased using current sources.  The bias points can be adjusted under digital control to trade power for performance and to allow different bias settings for different temperatures.  The input buffers, sample-and-hold amplifiers, \dword{adc}, and \dword{adc} reference buffers can be independently adjusted.  In addition, the band-gap reference circuit includes a bias current adjustment for an internal amplifier.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:\dword{coldadc} has four possible ways to interface with \dword{larasic}.  It can accept either single-ended inputs (provided by existing \dword{larasic} chips) or differential inputs (foreseen for a future \dword{larasis} upgrade).  In either case, to mitigate the risk that the input buffer circuits do not perform well, it is also possible to bypass the input buffers and apply the inputs directly to the sample-and-hold amplifiers.  The sample-and-hold amplifiers are separated into two groups of 8.  They sample the waveform at the rising edge of the (\SI{{\sim}2}{MHz}) sampling clock.  An internally generated \SI{16}{MHz} clock is then used to clock an 8-to-1 multiplexer that presents 8 samples in turn to one of the two \dword{adc} pipelines.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:A block diagram of the \dword{coldadc} pipeline stages is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:coldadc-pipeline}.  Each of the 15 stages contains a low-resolution 1.5-bit analog-to-digital sub-converter (ADSC) \fixme{This abbreviation is not in the glossary.} containing two comparators, a 1.5-bit digital-to-analog sub-converter (DASC) \fixme{Nor is this abbreviation in the glossary.} that produces an voltage based on the two comparator outputs, an analog subtractor, a sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) \fixme{Nor is this one.}, and a gain stage (with a gain of slightly less than two).  Each pipeline stage makes a three-level coarse decision based on the analog input voltage and then sends a voltage proportional to the quantization error resulting from the coarse decision to the next stage for further processing.  To limit power consumption, the stages of the \dword{adc} are scaled in area (and thus power) taking advantage of the fact that the accuracy requirements of the stages decline at each stage of the pipeline.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:The ten differential output drivers source and sink a current whose value can be digitally controlled.  The minimum current is 165 $\mu$A, which corresponds to approximately 3 mV peak-to-peak with 100$\Omega$ termination.  Seven additional levels spaced by 275 $\mu$A can be selected.  The maximum current is 2.07 mA, about 2/3 of the \dword{lvds} standard of 3.5 mA.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:The \dword{coldata} \dword{asic} was designed by engineers from \dword{fermilab} and Southern Methodist University.  It is responsible for all communications between the \dwords{}femb and the electronics outside the cryostat.  Each \dword{femb} contains two \dword{coldata} chips.  \dword{coldata} receives command and control information from a \dword{wib}.  Each \dword{coldata} provides clocks to four \dwords{coldadc} and relays commands to four \dword{larasic} front-end \dwords{asic} and four \dwords{coldadc} to set operating modes and initiate calibration procedures.  Each \dword{coldata} receives data from four \dwords{coldadc}, merges the data streams, provides 8b/10b encoding, serializes the data, and transmits the data to the warm electronics over two 1.28 Gbps links.  These links are driven by line drivers with programmable pre-emphasis.  A block diagram of \dword{coldata} is shown in Figure xx.yy. \fixme{Don't forget to replace this.}
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:Most commands are sent from a \dword{wib} to an \dword{femb} using an I2C-like\cite{I2C} protocol.  However, while standard I2C uses single ended \dword{cmos} signals and a bidirectional data line, because of the long cables required between the warm interface electronics and the \dwords{femb}, \dword{coldata} uses low voltage differential pairs for both the I2C clock and data.  Point-to-point links are used with a separate link used for data sent from warm to cold and for data sent from cold to warm.  To reduce the number of cables required, only one of the two \dword{coldata} chips on an \dword{femb} has its main I2C interface directly connected to a \dword{wib}.  That \dword{coldata} chip relays I2C commands and data to the secondary \dword{coldata} chip and relays I2C responses from the secondary \dword{coldata} to the \dword{wib}.  Each \dword{coldata} also relays I2C commands and data sent from the \dword{wib} to a \dword{coldadc} chip, as well as data sent back to the \dword{wib}  from a \dword{coldadc}.  This link (on the \dword{femb}) uses single ended \dword{cmos} signals, but data sent to the \dwords{coldadc} is still separate from data sent from the \dwords{coldadc} to the \dword{coldata}.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:\dword{coldata} interprets commands intended for a \dword{larasic} front-end chip and transmits them to the \dwords{larasic} using an SPI\cite{SPI} interface \fixme{Should SPI be in the glossary?}.  The configuration registers in \dword{larasic} are configured to be loaded as a single shift register.  As data is shifted into \dword{larasic} on the MOSI \fixme{Should this be in the glossary?} line, bits from the other end of the shift register are shifted out on the MISO \fixme{Also not in the glossary.} line.  It is thus only possible to read \dword{larasic} configuration registers while writing new configuration data.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:\dword{coldata} receives a master clock and a fast command signal from the \dword{wib} on a differential pair.  The master clock is nominally \SI{64}{MHz} but may be \SI{62.5}{MHz} if that is preferred for reasons related to system synchronization.  It creates a \SI{2}{MHz} ADC sampling clock by dividing the \SI{64}{MHz} clock by 32.  Each \dword{coldata} passes the \SI{64}{MHz} clock and the \SI{2}{MHz} clock to its four \dword{coldadc} chips.  If a \SI{62.5}{MHz} master clock is used, then \dword{coldadc} will convert input data every 512 ns rather than every 500 ns.  The fast command line is used for signals that must be executed at a known time.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:Both \dword{coldata} and \dword{coldadc} are implemented in the TSMC 65nm \dword{cmos} process.\cite{TSMC65} The designs were done using cold transistor models produced by Logix Consulting.\cite{Logix} Logix made measurements of \dword{fermilab}-supplied TSMC 65 nm transistors at LN2 temperature and extracted and provided to \dword{fermilab} SPICE~\cite{spice} models valid at LN2 temperature.  These models were used in analog simulations of \dword{coldata} and \dword{coldadc} subcircuits.  To eliminate the risk of accelerated aging due to the hot carrier effect,\cite{Hot-electron} no transistor with a channel length less than 90 nm was used in either \dword{asic} design.  A special library of standard cells using 90 nm channel length transistors was developed by members of the University of Pennsylvania and \dword{fermilab} groups.  Timing parameters were developed for this standard cell library using the Cadence Liberate tool\cite{Liberate} and the Logix SPICE models.  With the exception of the \dword{coldata} PLL \fixme{Should this be in the glossary?}, serializer, and output driver, the digital sections of \dword{coldata} and \dword{coldadc} were synthesized from Verilog code using this standard cell library and the Cadence Innovus tool~\cite{Innovus}. Innovus was also used for the layout of the synthesized logic.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:The SLAC \fixme{SLAC is not in the glossary.} \dword{cryo} \dword{asic} differs from the baseline three-chip design by combining the functions of an analog preamplifier, \dword{adc}, and data serialization and transmission for \num{64}~wire channels into a single chip.

sp-tpcelec-design.tex:The first iteration of the \dword{cryo} \dword{asic} design was submitted to MOSIS \fixme{MOSIS is not in the glossary.} for fabrication in November 2018.  The first prototypes should arrive in January 2019. Simulation-based studies have already been performed; at \SI{0.8}{\micro\second} peaking time and an input capacitance of \SI{200}{pF} (similar to that expected in the \dword{dune} \dword{spmod}), the \dword{enc} is approximately \num{500}\,e$^-$.  This noise level is similar to that expected with the baseline \dword{fe} and \dword{adc} \dword{asic} design in \dword{lar} with the same input capacitance.

sp-tpcelec-design.tex:The \dword{sbnd} collaboration has been exploring the \dword{cots} \dword{adc} option for the \dword{tpc} readout electronics development since Spring 2017~\cite{Chen:2018zic}. After a market survey, few candidate \dwords{adc} in \dword{sar} architecture were identified with 100\% cold yield. Since July 2017, a lifetime study plan was developed to evaluate \dword{cots} \dword{adc} in two different phases: exploratory and validation. The lifetime study focused on the \dword{adi} AD7274 implemented in TSMC 350nm \dword{cmos} technology given the optimum performance in cryogenic operation compared to other candidates.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:During the exploratory phase, fresh samples of \dword{cots} \dword{adc} AD7274 were stressed with higher than nominal operation voltage, such as 5 V, while power consumption (current drawn) was monitored continuously. Periodically, the sample would be operated at nominal voltage (V$_{DD}$ = 2.5V and V$_{REF}$ = 1.8V) for a performance characterization test, where both DNL (Differential Non-Linearity) and INL (Integral Non-Linearity) \fixme{DNL and INL should probably go into the glossary.} were monitored and analyzed in addition to the current monitoring. Stress test results were used to extrapolate the lifetime of the \dword{cots} \dword{adc}. We determined that the current drop of 1\% on the V$_{DD}$ be used as the degradation criterion for the lifetime study. In the validation phase, more devices were tested following the develped criteria to collect more data to validate what was learned in the exploratory phase.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:The lifetime projection of \dword{cots} \dword{adc} AD7274 from the stress test with V$_{DD} >$ 5V is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cotsadc-lifetime}. With ADC7274 operated at 2.5V, which is lower than the nominal 3.6V for 350nm \dword{cmos} technology, the projected lifetime is more than than 10$^6$ years.
sp-tpcelec-design.tex:Based on the lifetime study of AD7274, an \dword{femb} with \dword{cots} \dword{adc} was developed and characterized for an \dword{sbnd} experiment. The integration test was carried out with 40\% \dword{apa} at BNL and showed satisfactory noise performance in Figure~\ref{fig:cotsadc-fembenc}. The \dword{cots} \dword{adc} AD7274 serves as a backup solution for the \dword{dune} far detector \dword{tpc} readout electronics system.

sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:The most important interface is between the \dword{ce}
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:and the \dword{apa} consortia. The design of the \dwords{femb}
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:and of the \dword{apa}s are strictly intertwined, both from the
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:mechanical and electrical points of view. The \dword{ce}
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:boxes, which house the \dwords{femb}, are supported by the \dword{apa}
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:and, at the same time, attached to the CR boards of the \dword{apa}

sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:attached to the yoke of the \dword{apa}. The \dword{ce}
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:cables for the bottom \dword{apa} must be routed through the 
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:frames of both the bottom and top \dword{apa}s. The \dword{ce}
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:consortium provides the bias voltage for the \dword{apa}
sp-tpcelec-interfaces.tex:wires as well as for the electron diverters and the \dword{fc} termination electrodes (the latter are a responsibility of

The electronics are mounted inside the \dword{lar} to exploit the fact that charge carrier mobility in silicon is higher and that thermal fluctuations are lower at \dword{lar} temperature than at room temperature.  For \dword{cmos} (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) electronics, this results in substantially higher gain and lower noise at \dword{lar} temperature than at room temperature~\cite{larCMOS}.  Mounting the front-end electronics on the \dword{apa} frames also minimizes the input capacitance.  Furthermore, placing the digitizing and multiplexing (MUX) \fixme{This abbreviation is not in the glossary.}electronics inside the cryostat reduces the total number of penetrations into the cryostat and minimizes the number of cables coming out of the cryostat.  As the full \dword{tpc} electronics chain for the \dword{spmod} includes many components on the warm side of the cryostat as well, the \dword{dune} consortium designated to organize development of this system is called the \dword{dune} \textit{Single-Phase \dword{tpc} Electronics} consortium. It is sometimes referred to as the \dword{ce} consortium for short.
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:The overall noise requirement drives the choice of the \dword{tpc} electronics architecture. This requirement is difficult to establish precisely, but clearly, the less electronic noise, the better the physics reach of the \dword{dune} experiment will be.  An equivalent noise charge (\dword{enc}) of less than approximately 1000$e^-$ is required for satisfactory reconstruction of accelerator neutrino interactions, but a lower noise level will yield significantly better two-track separation and primary vertex resolution, and thus higher efficiency and/or lower background for identifying electron neutrino interactions.  Setting the noise level requirement for the \dword{dune} \dword{spmod} more precisely is an ongoing effort.
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:The noise level enabled by having the front-end electronics in the cold (roughly half as much noise at \dword{lar} temperature than at room temperature) greatly extends the reach of the \dword{dune} physics program.  Decreasing the noise level allows measurement of smaller charge deposits , a source of risk mitigation in case the desired drift field cannot be reached or the electron lifetime in the detector is less than desired (due to the electronegative impurities in the detector). Decreasing the noise level also increases the reach of low-energy physics measurements like those associated with stellar core-collapse supernova burst neutrinos.  Finally, a low noise level allows the experiment to use low-energy $\mathrm{{}^{39}Ar}$ beta decays to calibrate the \dword{dune} \dword{spmod}.  The noise level requirement of \dword{enc}\,$<\num{1000}\,e^-$ will allow the use of $\mathrm{{}^{39}Ar}$ beta decays in calibrations at the DUNE \dword{spmod}.
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:To retain maximum flexibility in optimizing reconstruction algorithms after the \dword{dune} data is collected, the \dword{spmod} electronics are designed to produce a digital record representing the waveform of the current produced by charge collection/induction on the anode wires.  Each anode wire signal is input to a charge sensitive amplifier, followed by a pulse shaping circuit and an \dword{adc}.  To minimize the number of cables and cryostat penetrations, the \dwords{adc} as well as the amplifier/shapers are located in the \dword{lar}, and digitized data from many wires merge onto a much smaller set of high speed serial links.  %[Figure xx illustrates the front-end electronics architecture.  128-channel “Front-End Mother Boards” produce digitized waveforms and transmit those waveforms on four serial links through a \fdth in the top of the cryostat to “Warm Interface Boards” located in crates mounted directly on spool pieces on the outside of the cryostat.

sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:\item{a \num{64}-channel control and communications \dword{asic} (referred to as \dword{coldata}).}
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:The \dword{fe} \dword{asic} has been prototyped and is close to meeting requirements (discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-overview-scope}). Another prototype to address issues in the version deployed in \dword{pdsp} should be finished in early 2019. Key portions of the control and communications \dword{asic} (also called the \dword{coldata} \dword{asic}) have been prototyped and meet requirements.  However, we have determined that the BNL-designed P1-\dword{adc} \dword{asic} now being used in \dword{pdsp} does not meet requirements, and accordingly, its development has been terminated.  A new \dword{adc} \dword{asic} (also called the cold \dword{adc} \dword{asic}) is being developed by an LBNL-\fnal-BNL collaboration; first prototypes should be ready in February 2019.  The first full prototype of the controls and communication \dword{asic} should also be available for testing in June 2019.
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:To maximize the probability of quickly developing a complete design for cold TPC \dword{fe} electronics, an alternative solution is also being investigated: a single \num{64}-channel \dword{asic} that will consolidate all three functions listed above.  This design is being done at SLAC, and the first prototypes will be tested in February 2019.  An \dword{adc} solution in the form of a commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) option serves as an additional backup option and has already been tested; this option will be explored further if the other two \dword{adc} solutions being considered do not meet the requirements for \dword{dune}.
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:While the higher charge carrier mobility at \dword{lar} temperature than at room temperature is central to improving the performance of \dword{ce}, it also leads to the \textit{hot carrier effect}.  In n-type MOS \fixme{This abbreviation is not in the glossary.} transistors, the carriers (electrons) can acquire enough kinetic energy to ionize silicon in the active channel.  This charge can become trapped and lead to effects (including threshold shifts) similar to those caused by radiation damage.  This effect can cause MOS circuits to age much more quickly at \dword{lar} temperature than at room temperature, reducing performance and potentially causing failure.  To mitigate this effect, the maximum \efield in transistor channels must be lower than the field that can be reliably used at room temperature.  This is accomplished by using transistors fabricated longer than is typical and operated at reduced bias voltage.  Any commercial circuits used in the \dword{lar} must be carefully tested to ensure they will perform well for the expected \num{20}-year lifetime of \dword{dune}; reliability studies for front-end electronics designs in consideration are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-reliability}.
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:A series of tests are planned to demonstrate that the \dword{ce} system design will meet \dword{dune} requirements. These include two system tests: one using the \dword{pdsp} \textit{cold box} at CERN and one using a new small \dword{lartpc} at \fnal. The latter will also accommodate one half-length \dword{dune} \dword{pd} and will provide a low-noise environment that will allow detailed comparisons of the performance of the new \dwords{asic}. It will also enable the study of interactions between the \dword{tpc} readout and other systems, including the \dword{pd} readout and the \dword{hv} distribution. These test facilities are discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-facilities}. A second period of data taking is also planned for the \dword{pdsp} detector, with final \dword{apa}s including the final \dwords{asic} and \dwords{femb} replacing the current prototypes. This second run of \dword{pdsp} is planned for 2021-2022.
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:In addition to the noise requirement (less than \num{1000}\,$e^{-}$), several additional requirements determine most of the other important \dword{tpc} electronics specifications:  
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:\item{The \dword{fe} peaking time must  %should 
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:\item{The \dword{fe} must %should 
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:\item{The \dword{adc} sampling frequency must %should 
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:be \SI{{\sim}2}{MHz}.  This value is chosen to match a \dword{fe} shaping time of \SI{1}{\micro\second} (approximate Nyquist condition) while minimizing the data rate.}
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:\item{The \dword{adc} must not contribute significantly to overall \dword{fe} noise. This requirement depends on the gain of the \dword{fe} but for each gain setting, translates into requirements on \dword{adc} parameters, including non-linearity and noise.}
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:\item{The \dword{adc} must digitize the charge deposited on the wires with 12~bits of precision.  The lower end of the \dword{adc} dynamic range is driven by the requirement that the ADC digitization does not contribute to total electronics noise. The upper end of the \dword{adc} dynamic range is defined by the previous requirement for the signal saturation level. Combining these two requirements with the specification for the total electronics noise results in the need for 12~bits digitization.}
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:\item{The power dissipated by the electronics located in the \dword{lar} must 
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:be less than \SI{50}{mW/channel}.  Lower power dissipation is desirable because the mass of the power cables scales with  power.  Ongoing studies focus on whether the amount of power dissipated by the electronics should be minimized further because of potential complications from argon boiling; in principle, this should not be a problem because the \dword{ce} boxes housing the \dwords{femb} are designed to channel bubbles to the \dword{apa} frames.}
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:Finally, all electronics in the \dword{lar} must 
sp-tpcelec-overview.tex:be highly reliable because accessing the \dword{ce} for repair is not possible once the cryostat is filled with \dword{lar}. Ongoing studies are quantifying the effect of failures in the \dword{tpc} and electronics, including single wire failures and failures of groups of \num{16}, \num{64}, or \num{128} channels.

The system was deployed in a beam line of the CERN Neutrino Platform in 2018 and continues to take cosmic event data into 2019. The goal of the \dword{protodune}-\dword{sp} \dword{tpc} readout was to validate the concept and the design of the integrated \dword{apa}+\dword{ce} readout and measure the performance of the \dword{ce} system with components as close as possible to the final \dword{dune} \dword{tpc} readout.

Each one was tested in a full scale cold box in cold gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) with a complete \dword{ce} readout system identical to the one on the detector before installation in the cryostat.

Figure~\ref{fig:apa3-noise} shows the \dword{enc} in electrons for all channels of one of the \dword{apa}+\dword{ce} readout units. The collection channels with \dword{enc}$>$1500~e$^-$ are caused by an artifact in the generation of cold \dword{adc} \dword{asic} used in \dword{protodune}-\dword{sp}.

sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{tdr} (Volume 7 Chapter 9). %Commented out because it breaks the automatic build system %(\refch{tc}{vl:tc-QA}).
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:The goal of the \dword{qa} plan is to maximize the number of functioning
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:respect, the experience gained with the \dword{pdsp} prototype is extremely
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:components. The lessons learned during the construction of \dword{pdsp},

sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:graded approach to \dword{qa} indicates that particular care must be used for installing the \dword{ce} components inside the cryostat.
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:A complete \dword{qa} plan starts with ensuring that the designs of all
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:The other aspects of the \dword{qa} plan involve documenting the 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:collected during the \dword{qc} process, training and qualifying 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{qc} procedures are applied uniformly across
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:and installation. The \dword{ce} consortium plan involves
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:having multiple sites using the same \dword{qc} procedures,
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:of the \dword{qa} plan. Reference parts will be tested at
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:the \dword{qc} process will be stored in a common database, and
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:gained with \dword{pdsp}. A first version of the testing procedures
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:tested. The \dword{qc} procedures will be then reviewed
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:will be analyzed, and a final and improved \dword{qc} process will be 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:of the \dword{qc} process will be reviewed at regular intervals

sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:(\dword{larasic}, \dword{coldadc}, \dword{coldata}, and \dword{cryo}). 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:When a new prototype \dword{asic} is produced, the groups responsible for the \dword{asic} design will perform the first tests of 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{asic} functionality and performance. These tests may use either 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:the extent to which the \dword{asic} functions as intended, both at room 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:of \dword{fe} \dwords{asic} include measurements of noise as a function 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:differential as well as integral non-linearity. Tests of \dword{coldata} and \dword{cryo} 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:cables at least as long at the longest cables needed in the \dword{dune} far detectors 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:with real \dword{apa}s attached to the readout.In addition, possible system issues generated by interaction with different detector components will be investigated.
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{pdsp} is designed as a full slice of the \dword{spmod} as close as 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:possible to the final \dword{dune}\dword{sp} components. It contains six full-size 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{dune} \dword{apa}s instrumented with \num{20} \dwords{femb} each for a 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:the wires on each \dword{apa} are read out via a full \dword{ce} readout 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:system, including a \dword{ce} flange and \dword{wiec} with five \dwords{wib} 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:and one \dword{ptc}. Each combined \dword{apa} and \dword{ce} readout follows 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{pdsp} took beam data in the CERN neutrino platform in 2018 and will continue
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:(ENC$<$600e$^-$ and 800$^-$, respectively) satisfy the \dword{dune}\dword{sp} requirements described 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:and testing of the \dword{ce} and the \dword{pdsp} beam data run will be incorporated into the 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:next iteration of the system design for the \dword{spmod}.
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:Five of the six \dword{apa}s were tested in the \dword{pdsp} cold box, which is described in
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:These tests were critical in identifying issues with \dword{ce} components after installation 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:on the \dword{apa}. Therefore, a very similar set of cold box tests are planned at \dword{surf} 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:with the fully-instrumented \dword{dune} \dword{apa}s. A seventh \dword{apa} will be delivered
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:to CERN in January 2019 and equipped at first with \dword{pdsp} \dwords{femb}. This
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{apa} will be characterized in the cold box like the \dword{apa}s installed
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:in \dword{pdsp}, establishing a reference point for further tests that will be
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:performed after replacing half of the \dwords{femb} with new prototypes equipped with the new \dwords{asic} being developed for \dword{dune}. 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:The \dword{dune} \dword{apa}s and the readout electronics will differ from the ones used 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:in \dword{pdsp}. For this reason, we are planning to re-open the \dword{pdsp} cryostat 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:and replace three of the six \dword{apa}s with final \dword{dune} prototypes that also include 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:with this new configuration of \dword{pdsp} is planned for 2021-2022. This will also 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:allow another opportunity to check for interference between the readout of the \dword{apa} 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:wires and either the \dword{pds} or other cryogenic instrumentation.
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:The main drawbacks of the tests in the cold box at CERN are that the \dword{apa}
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:issues, \dword{fermilab} has built a new cryostat (\dword{iceberg}) that will be used for 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{lar} detector R\&D and for system tests of the \dword{ce} prototypes. 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:The \dword{iceberg} cryostat, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ICEBERG-cryotee} is installed
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:at the Proton Assembly Building at \dword{fermilab}. It has an inner diameter of \SI{152}{cm}
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:and can hold about 35,000 liters of \dword{lar}, sufficient to house a
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{tpc} with dimensions \SI{125}{cm}~$\times$~\SI{125}{cm}~$\times$~\SI{60}{cm}. For \dword{dune} 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:purposes, this cryostat will house a 1,280-channel \dword{tpc}, shown in
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:Figure~\ref{fig:ICEBERG-tpcdaq}, with an \dword{apa} and two \dwords{fc}, each 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:enclosing a sensitive volume with a maximum drift distance of \SI{25}{cm}. The \dword{apa} 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:has been built using the same wire boards and anchoring elements of  \dword{pdsp} 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:1/10$^{th}$ of a \dword{dune} \dword{apa}. The \dword{apa} mechanics are designed to accommodate 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:two half-length \dword{pdsp} bars with dimensions and connectors that already 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:include the design modifications planned for \dword{dune}. Power, readout, and controls 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:use equipment identical to those used for \dword{pdsp}. The interface between the 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dwords{femb} and the \dword{apa} wires uses the same CR boards used 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:for \dword{pdsp} and described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-apa-boards}. The \dword{tpc} is
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:readout via a \dword{daq} system (also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ICEBERG-tpcdaq})

sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:\dword{ce} prototypes will be measured with actual tracks from cosmic rays 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:reconstructed within the \dword{tpc}. In addition, system studies with new 
sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:prototypes of the \dword{pds} will be performed because the \dword{apa} is

sp-tpcelec-qa.tex:perform measurements with tracks, but the \dword{apa} is
