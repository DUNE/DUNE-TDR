Coordination of the groups participating in the \dword{dune} \dword{apa} consortium is critical to successfully executing the large-scale multi-year construction project that is needed to produce high-quality \dword{apa}s for the \dword{dune} \dwords{spmod}.   The \dword{apa} consortium comprises \num{21} institutions, of which \num{14} are in the USA and \num{7} in the UK (see Table~\ref{tab:apa-institutions}). The consortium is organized along the main deliverables, which are the final design of the \dword{apa} and the \dword{apa} production and installation procedures (see Figure~\ref{fig:apa-consortium-structure}).  The two main centers of \dword{apa} construction are in the USA and the UK, so usually the leaders of a working group are chosen to represent the main stakeholders to ensure that common procedures and tooling are developed.  We plan to produce half of the \dword{dune} \dword{apa}s in the USA and half in the UK. \fixme{4 production lines in UK, 6 in USA - half and half??}

The university groups and \dword{bnl} are responsible for validating  the design, while engineering and the production set up is being developed at PSL %at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
(USA) and Daresbury Laboratory (UK), where the \dword{apa}s for \dword{pdsp} have been built. 
In addition to PSL and Daresbury Laboratory, the University of Chicago and Yale University are developing detailed plans for the layouts, activities, and schedule at each site. 


In addition to the \dword{apa} production sites, a successful production effort will require significant and sustained contributions from university groups throughout the production process.  Table~\ref{tab:apa-institution-roles} and Figure~\ref{fig:apa-construction-org} list the main work packages that are part of the overall \dword{apa} construction process and the institutions in the USA and UK who are taking the leading roles in each effort.  The tasks range from the production of bare support frames, to the assembly and testing of many thousands of wire boards, to the procurement of the custom transport crates for shipping the completed \dword{apa}s.  The on-time supply of materials to each of the \dword{apa} production sites will be imperative to maintaining the production schedule, and detailed plans are being developed for the execution of the project in both countries.
