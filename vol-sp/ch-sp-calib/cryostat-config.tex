Figure~\ref{fig:calib-FTmap} shows the current cryostat design for the %DUNE SP FD 
\dword{spmod} with penetrations for various subsystems. The penetrations dedicated to calibration are the highlighted black circles. 
%The ports on the far east and far west are outside the \dword{fc}. The current plan is to use these penetrations for several different purposes. For example, the penetrations on the far east and west will be used both by laser and radioactive source systems (if deployed). 

In addition to these dedicated ports, there are plans to use the \dword{dss} and cryogenics ports (orange and blue dots in Figure~\ref{fig:calib-FTmap}) as needed to route cables for other calibration systems, e.g., fiber optic cables for the \dword{pd} calibration system, which is described elsewhere, in \dword{tdr} \spchpds. \dword{dss} and cryogenics ports can be accommodated by feedthroughs with a CF63 side flange for this purpose.

The current plan is to use the calibration ports for several different purposes, but their placement is largely driven by requirements for the ionization track laser. %and radioactive source system. 
The ports %that are %inwards 
toward the center of the cryostat are placed near the \dword{apa}s, where the \efield is small, %\fixme{check} 
to minimize any risks due to %the
\dword{hv} discharge. \dword{hv} is not an issue for the far east and west ports since they are located outside the \dword{fc} and the penetrations are located %near 
close to mid-drift (a location favorable for possible source deployment).
%to meet radioactive source requirements. 
%\fixme{The amendment above may need some work. I won't look at it until it's ready.}
Implementing the baseline ionization track laser system as %proposed 
described in Section~\ref{sec:sp-calib-sys-las-ion} requires \num{12} feedthroughs, the three central ones in each of the four \dword{tpc} drift volumes; this arrangement allows lasers to be used for full volume calibration of the \efield and associated diagnostics (e.g., \dword{hv}). 

The distance between any two consecutive feedthrough columns shown in Figure~\ref{fig:calib-FTmap} is approximately \SI{15}{\m}. Since the \dword{microboone} laser system has shown that tracks will propagate over that detector's full \SI{10}{\m} length, this distance is considered reasonable.   Assuming that the effects of Rayleigh scattering and self-focusing (Kerr effect) do not limit the laser track length, this laser arrangement could illuminate the full volume with crossing tracks in the central region, and single tracks %coverage 
in the region closer to the end-walls.  %Please note that, 
At this time, the maximum usable track length is unknown, and it may be that the full \SI{60}{\m} \detmodule length could be covered by the laser system after optimization.
