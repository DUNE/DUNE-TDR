\subsubsection{End-wall coverage enhancement}

The eight calibration ports closer to the end-walls (four on each side) are not positioned on top of the \dword{tpc}, but instead located about \SI{40}{\cm} away from the \dword{fc} along the $z$ (beamline) direction. If positioned on top, \dword{fc} penetration would be quite complicated, having to come from the sides. Use of the periscope baseline design for the end-wall periscopes would severely limit the volume coverage, similar to the coverage limitation mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:sp-calib-sys-las-ion-des}.

We describe here an alternative design for the end-wall ports that would improve the laser beam coverage without requiring \dword{fc} penetration.
%or long horizontal tracks. 

The periscope is exactly the same as the baseline design but, at the top of the calibration port, is mounted on a flange that has an additional rotation degree of freedom. Figure~\ref{fig:laser_extrarotation} presents a preliminary drawing of the concept. The \SI{250}{\milli\m} diameter calibration port has on top of it the main rotary flange that, itself, has another smaller port off-centered by \SI{40}{\milli\m} with respect to the main one. On this smaller port, a secondary rotary flange is installed and it is this one that holds the laser periscope, including the optical feedthrough and the linear stage for mirror movement. When the main flange rotates, the periscope also moves along a circular (\SI{40}{\milli\m} diameter) trajectory. Consequently, within the cryostat, the relative position between the beam mirror and the \dword{fc} profiles changes as well, and so the shadowed regions also change, by parallax. Using different main rotary flange angles, it should be possible to locate the mirror in enough different positions in order to cover all the previously shadowed angles.

Calculations similar to the ones showed earlier show that, using only \num{3} different positions (separated by \ang{90}), a coverage of \SI{94}{\%} should be possible for \SI{30}{\cm} voxels and allowing all tracks directed at the \dword{apa}.

The calibration port is shown in brown at the bottom; the primary and secondary rotary flanges are shown in yellow,  with the (black) motors next to them. The optical feedthrough is shown in the center, in blue. On top, the mirror arrangement allows the laser beam to be aligned with the optical feedthrough no matter the angle of each of the rotary flanges.}

%In terms of cryostat penetration, the design of the feedthrough and periscope would follow the baseline one, but the $\theta$ angle would be practically always \ang{45}, with only minor adjustments, and the phi angle would flip between \ang{0} and \ang{180}.

%%The reflected beam is parallel to the \dword{fc} wall and perpendicular to the \dword{apa}. There would have to be a new \num{14}~m long tray for the movement of the secondary mirror(s). 
%Long plastic threaded rods could be used for the movement along the tray. Rotation of the first rod would push/pull a small platform along the tray, and the rotation of the second rod is transmitted to a mechanism on that platform to achieve the rotation around the $x$ axis.

%The \dword{fc} profiles are \SI{4.6}{\cm} wide with a \SI{1.4}{\cm} gap between them. That's the gap close to which the mirror needs to stop. That means that there is a finite amount of $x$ values where we can position the mirror, effectively every \SI{6}{\cm}. In order to correct for possible \dword{fc} shifts, one can use the laser positioning system to see if beam is passing to the other side. Choosing the $z$ coordinate of the tray to be located close to an edge of the drift volume, the angular range of movement needed to fully cover a vertical plane with the rotation of the mirror is only \ang{90}.

%This mirror movement system has the following advantages:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item good coverage of most of the \dword{tpc} active volume, even  from outside the \dword{fc};
%\item the same calibration port laser can illuminate all drift volumes;
%\item with the beam always parallel to the \dword{apa}, especially the \dword{pds}, less risk of hitting the \dword{pds}
%directly or by reflecting from the cathode although reflections from the \dword{fc} profiles are still possible).

%The reference system does have the following possible disadvantages:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Construction requires more moving parts and movement transmitted at long distances, so the mechanical precision may be more challenging to achieve the same precision as in the baseline;
%\item The \dword{fc} profiles may shift during cooling, creating a need to fine-tune the alignment of the mirror with the \dword{fc} gaps. This can be done with the laser positioning system described in Section~\ref{sec:calib-laser-pos};

%\paragraph{Horizontal track along end-wall}

%The baseline design is based on laser entry points in which the movement of the steering mirror has two angular degrees of freedom.
%A possible alternative design would change that end part of the system so that there is a translation and a rotation movement. At the end of the vertical periscope, a mirror at a \ang{45} angle would send the beam horizontally, perpendicular to the \dword{apa}/\dword{cpa}, and externally to the field cage. A horizontal track, installed in that same direction, would allow the translation movement of a secondary mirror (or two of them, one on each side), mounted with an angle of \ang{45} with respect to the incident beam. This allows the mirror to be aligned with the \SI{1.4}{\cm} wide gaps between the \dword{fc} profiles. This second mirror would have a rotation movement, around the same axis, keeping the \ang{45} angle to the beam, but causing its reflection to sweep a vertical plane. Figure~\ref{fig:Laser_alternative2} provides an illustration of the mirror movements in this arrangement.

%In terms of cryostat penetration, the design of the feedthrough and periscope would follow the baseline. The horizontal track could hang down from the calibration ports, and long plastic threaded rods supported by it could be used to transmit translation and rotation movement to the secondary mirror. It appears quite challenging to implement such a system for this translation and rotation movement, that meets the \efield and cryogenic constraints within the \dword{dune} cryostat, as well as the mechanical precision requirements.
%Still, if possible, this solution would have very good TPC coverage (even if somewhat limited by the horizontal \dword{fc} support bars), and possibly allow for only one laser to be used at each end-wall.

%{\it End-wall \dword{fc} penetration:}\\ 
%The best possible \dword{tpc} coverage should be achieved with \dword{fc} penetration. A conceptual plan for this, sketched in Figure~\ref{fig:laser-alt-ewpen1} would be to build L-shaped periscopes that, using Cardan joints, would change the periscope rotation axis (and the translation stage movement) from vertical to horizontal, in order to actuate the mirror inside the \dword{tpc}. In addition to solving the mechanical issues associated with the L-shaped transmission, the effect of such openings on the \efield still needs to be carefully studied, since the end-wall calibration ports are not located close to the \dwords{apa}, but are at about \SI{2}{\m} in the drift direction, so their impact is higher than in the case described in Section~\ref{sec:lasertopfcpen}.
