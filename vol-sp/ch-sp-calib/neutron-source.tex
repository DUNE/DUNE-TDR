%\subsubsection{Physics Motivation}
%\label{sec:sp-calib-sys-pns-phys} 

%The supernova signal includes low energy (\SI{10}{\MeV}) electrons, gammas; the final state will also include neutrons visible via capture. Such signals may be sensitive to (local) detector threshold effects, and energy scale, energy resolution; the requirements for these are \SI{0.5}{\MeV}, \SI{1}{\%}, \SI{5}{\%} respectively. 

The supernova signal includes low energy (also below \SI{10}{\MeV}) electrons, gammas; the final state will also include neutrons visible via capture on argon. Such signals will be sensitive to (local) detector threshold effects, and energy scale, energy resolution. 
As noted in the physics volume of the \dword{tdr}, 
the sensitivity to \dword{snb} physics 
%(see Chapter 7 of the \dword{dune} physics \dword{tdr}) 
is dependent on the uncertainties on these detector response parameters, and so a calibration method to constrain those uncertainties is needed.
Local detector conditions may change with time from a variety of 
%sources,
causes and include electronics noise, misalignments, fluid flow, and \efield. While these are intended to be characterized from other systems via inputs to the detector model, ``standard candles'' provide a method to assess if our detector model is incomplete or insufficient. An ideal ``standard candle'' matches one of the relevant signal processes. The \dlong{pns} (\dshort{pns}) system, as described below, will provide a ``standard candle'' neutron capture signal (\SI{6.1}{\MeV} multi-gamma) across the entire \dword{dune} volume which is directly relevant to the supernova physics signal characterization.

%\fixme{SG: this intro needs fixing; our systems are not competing with each other, we need to present them as complimentary systems, so no need to say one is better than the other. I will edit this accordingly so the message is healthy for our maximum benefit.}


%In a TPC the energy reconstruction of a track depends on the amount of charge detected from electrons drifting from the track to the collection plane. For a fixed amount of ionization deposited at a point in the TPC, the amount of charge produced and collected depends on several factors: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The local electric field strength affects the fraction of charge that recombines before drifting. The stronger the field, the less immediate recombination takes place, and thus the ratio of drifting electrons to energy deposited increases.
%\item The electron lifetime depends strongly on the purity of the argon liquid. Given the large size of the DUNE TPC, the restrictions to flow in the active volume, and a likely temperature gradient inside the liquid - it can be expected that there will be parts of the detecter where the electron lifetime will be shorter than others. The prediction of exactly how this manifests is difficult to predict {\it ab initio}.
%\item The distance electroncs have to drift to be collected depends on the location of the vertex inside the volume. The longer the drift, the more likeley it is an electron will be absorbed.
%\item Some parts of the detector can, in principle. be better or worse than others in terms of noise. This can affect the threshold charge collection systematically for different areas or the detector.
%\end{enumerate}

%Given these facts, it is highly desirable to be able to have a "standard candle" energy deposition of known energy that can be detected throughout the volume. Such a standard deposition would reveal variations in the local electron collection efficiency, especially if the source could be triggered such that the $t_0$ of the interaction was known.
%In principle, radioactive sources of known energy distribution could be deployed throughout the detector, but there are several problems with this approach: (1)  the source must be physically placed at the point one wishes to check, requiring multiple deployments in order to sample a significant volume of the detector, (2) the presence of the source itself can alter the electric field and ionization yield, and (3) the introduction of a foreign object into the active volume of the detector carries the risk of introducing impurities and/or radioactive contaminants. In addition, in order to have a triggered source (and hence some idea of $t_0$) one would have to introduce trigger electronics or other instrumentation - further complicating the deployment and increasing the risk.

%A way around this dilemma is to introduce short-lived radioactive atoms into the liquid argon itself, but this has the disadvantage  that there is no trigger and no way to ensure the standard candle decays spread out through the whole volume. In addition, to be useful such isotopes would have to have appreciable half-lives in order to have time to spread around the detector, and thus the whole process might take many hours. Finally, such isotopes would likely need to be made locally, which can be expensive and difficult.

%One way around these issues is to take advantage of a remarkable property of argon - the near transparency to neutrons with an energy near 57 keV due to an anti-resonance in the cross-section caused by the destructive interference between two high level states of the $^{40}$Ar nucleus. 
%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Arxsec}, 
%The cross-section at the anti-resonance "dip" is about 10 keV wide, and at the bottom the cross section of $1.6\times 10^{-4}\; b$ implies an elastic scattering length of over $2,000\;m$. Thus to neutrons of this energy the DUNE TPC is essentially transparent, and thus if injected from the top of the detector would reach energy part of the active volume. Of course, natural argon has three major isotopes: $^{36}$Ar (0.3336\%), $^{38}$Ar (0.0834\%), and $^{40}$Ar (99.6035\%) each with a slightly different anti-resonance. \\

Liquid argon is near transparent to neutrons with an energy near or at \SI{57}{\keV} due to an anti-resonance in the cross-section caused by the destructive interference between two high level states of the \argon40 nucleus (see Fig.~\ref{fig:PNS_xsections}). The cross-section at the anti-resonance ``dip'' is about \SI{10}{\keV} wide, and at the bottom the cross section of \SI{1.6e-4}{\barn} implies an elastic scattering length of over \SI{2000}{\m}. %Of course, natural

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{graphics/PNS_xsection.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

Natural argon has three major isotopes: \isotope{Ar}{36} (\SI{0.3336}{\%}), \isotope{Ar}{38} (\SI{0.0834}{\%}), and \isotope{Ar}{40} (\SI{99.6035}{\%}) each with a slightly different anti-resonance. The average elastic scattering length of the \SI{57}{\keV} neutrons in natural liquid argon is about \SI{30}{\m}.

The neutrons at the anti-resonance energy could be injected into liquid argon in the TPC, provided no materials (e.g. hydrocarbons) blocks the path. Those that do scatter lose energy, leave the anti-resonance, quickly slow down and are captured. Each capture releases exactly the binding energy difference between \isotope{Ar}{40} and \isotope{Ar}{41}, about \SI{6.1}{\MeV} in the form of $\gamma$ rays.  As will be described below, by using a {\it DD} Generator (where {\it DD} stands for ``Deuterium-Deuterium''), a triggered pulse of neutrons can be generated outside the TPC, then injected via a dedicated opening in the insulation into the liquid argon, where it spreads through the \SI{58}{\m} volume of the detector to produce \SI{6.1}{\MeV} energy depositions.
%Using this method, the calibration procedure would be quick (likely a few hours depending on the neutron yield of the DD generator), and there is no need to manufacture short-lived isotopes at an external facility.

The neutron capture cross-section and the $\gamma$ spectrum have been measured and characterized. Recently, the ACED Collaboration performed a neutron capture experiment using  the Detector  for Advanced  Neutron  Capture  Experiments  at DANCE (ACED)  at the  Los  Alamos  Neutron  Science  Center  (LANSCE). The result of neutron capture cross-section was published~\cite{Fischer:2019qfr} and will be used to prepare a database for the neutron capture studies. The data analysis of the energy spectrum of correlated gamma cascades from neutron captures is underway and will be published soon. Fig.~\ref{fig:PNS_gamma_ACED} shows an example of the energy spectra of individual gamma clusters measured by ACED. The gamma energy spectrum and the branching ratios in ENDF library will be updated with the ACED result.

\subsubsection{Design}
\label{sec:sp-calib-sys-pns-des}

The basic design concept of such a \dlong{pns} has been used successfully for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy~\cite{bib:Koivunoro2004}. The design of the \dword{pns} system used for energy calibration is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PNS_Moderator}. The system will consist of four main components: a $DD$ generator, an energy moderator reducing the energy of the $DD$ neutrons down to the desired level, and the shielding materials, and a neutron monitor to confirm neutron flux and safe operation. 

\begin{dunefigure}[Conceptual design of the \dlong{pns}]{fig:PNS_Moderator}
{Conceptual design of the \dlong{pns}. The whole device is placed outside the \dword{tpc} volume on top of the cryostat.}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{PNS_Moderator.png}
\end{dunefigure}



{\bf DD generator source:} $DD$ generators are commercial devices that can be readily obtained from several vendors at a cost of about \$\num{125}k each, which includes all control electronics. The pulse width is adjustable and can be delivered from about \SIrange{10}{1000}{\micro\s} (which affects the total output). 

{\bf Moderator:}  A feasible moderator has been designed using a layered Moderator~(Fe or Si)-Filter~(S)-Absorber~(Li) %layered 
configuration. The \SI{2.5}{\MeV} neutrons from the $DD$ generator are slowed down to below \SI{1}{\MeV} by the energy moderator. Natural iron and silicon are found to be efficient moderators for this purpose. Then an energy filter made of sulfur powder is used to further select the neutrons with desired anti-resonance energy.
The neutron anti-resonance energy in \isotope{S}{32} is \SI{73}{\keV}, right above the \SI{57}{\keV} anti-resonance energy in \argon40. The neutrons at this energy lose about \SI{3.0}{\keV} per elastic scattering length. After a few elastic scattering interactions, most of the \SI{73}{\keV} neutrons selected by the sulfur filter will fall into the \SI{57}{\keV} anti-resonance energy region in liquid argon. These materials require no cooling or special handling. Finally, a thermal absorbing volume of Lithium is placed at the entry to the argon pool in order to capture any neutrons that may have fallen below the \SI{57}{\keV} threshold. The reflecting volume is added around the $DD$ generator and the neutron moderator to increase downward neutron flux. 

{\bf Shielding:} The source will be encased in a shielding volume. The goal of the shield is to block both scattered neutrons and gammas which are produced in the source. Lithium-Polyethylene (\SI{7.5}{\%}) is chosen to be the material for the neutron shield because it is rich in hydrogen and lithium atoms which yield a high neutron absorption cross section. Lithium-Polyethylene is also light weight, commercially available, and relatively inexpensive. The energy spectrum entering the shield has multiple peaks between \SI{0.5}{\MeV} and \SI{1.5}{\MeV}, and one major spike at \SI{2.2}{\MeV}. The shield is able to effectively block the lower energy peaks but is only able to degrade the intensity of the \SI{2.2}{\MeV}. This is because \SI{2.2}{\MeV} gammas are a characteristic signature for neutron captures on hydrogen. A safe thickness of the lithium-polyethylene shield must be found such that it is capable of degrading the dose of \SI{2.2}{\MeV} gammas to safe levels. The dose of radiation from \SI{2.2}{\MeV} gammas was then calculated assuming a person standing \SI{1}{\m} away. Simulation indicates that \SI{12}{\cm} of Lithium-Polyethylene shield satisfies basic safety requirements. 

{\bf Neutron Monitor:} The system will need a monitoring system to confirm the source is operating as expected.  A neutron monitoring detector consisting of an Eljen EJ-420 coupled to an ADIT L51B16S \num{2}-inch \dword{pmt} will be placed just outside of the moderating material surrounding the $DD$ generator and will be read out with a CAEN waveform digitizer with neutron/$\gamma$ pulse-shape discriminating firmware. The monitoring detector will provide relative flux information to the calibration users and will ensure that the intensity of the source is constant, thereby allowing a comparison of data taking at different times.  A small collimator will be placed in front of the neutron detector, and inside the shielding material of the $DD$ source. The collimator dimensions and material specifications (likely a combination of iron, lead, and polyethylene) will be optimized from Monte Carlo simulations.

\begin{dunefigure}[Two designs for the \dlong{pns}]{fig:PNS_Two_Designs}
{Two designs being developed for the \dlong{pns}. Design A: Large format neutron source deployed above/inside the human access holes or other delicate neutron injection ports; Design B: Small format neutron source deployed inside the calibration feedthrough ports.}
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{PNS_Two_Designs.png}
\end{dunefigure}

Based on the general concept, two different designs were studied with GEANT4 simulation. Figure~\ref{fig:PNS_Two_Designs} shows a conceptual layout of the neutron injection system. %\todo{For v2, confirm updated figure; minor error in current one.}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Design A: Large format Moderator;} \\
The neutron source is about \SI{0.8}{\m} wide and \SI{1}{\m} high. It would sit above the cryostat insulator. Beneath the neutron source, a cylinder insulator volume with a diameter of more than \SI{50}{\cm} has to be removed to allow the neutrons to get into the cryostat. Such an interface is provided by the human access ports near the endwalls of the detector; a picture of this is shown for \dword{protodune} in Figure~\ref{fig:manhole2}. The top flange is sealed, and the neutron source sits on top, 
%(Design A), 
providing heat insulation; The neutron source weighs about \SI{1.6}{\tonne} and will hang on the I-beam supporting structure. This design allows a permanent deployment of the neutron source. GEANT4 simulation has shown that \SI{0.13}{\%} of the neutrons generated by the $DD$ generator are expected to be captured inside the liquid argon TPC. It is also possible to place the neutron source inside the human access ports which would allow a factor of \num{6} increase of the neutron flux but will require a modification of the interface flange. This is currently being investigated.
% JW: I think It doesn't harm to mention that the neutron source could be placed inside the manhole. My recent simulation is based on this configuration.

%\item \fixme{KM: I do not think this is possible for quite a few reasons-- heat loss and also cost of adjusting this. Remnoving this for now.} Design B: Large format Moderator; no insulation between Moderator and cryostat membrane The design of the the neutron source itself would be same as Design A. The only difference is that the neutron source will be placed inside a hole on the cryostat insulator. The cryostat will be kept closed, but there is no vacuum insulation between the neutron moderator and the stainless steel membrane. As the neutron source is closer to the liquid argon cryostat, the neutron flux is expected to be a factor of 10 higher than that of Design A. However, the neutron source must be removed and the insulator has to be recovered after the calibration run. 
\item {\it Design B: Small format Moderator;}\\
no insulation between Moderator liquid argon. An alternative method for delivering the neutrons is to use the existing calibration feedthroughs. In the current cryostat design, \num{20} calibration feedthroughs with a \SI{20}{\cm} inner diameter will be available on top of the cryostat. One can design the neutron source with an ultra-thin $DD$ generator that fits the size of the feedthrough. The problem is that there will be no space in the feedthrough for the shielding materials to fit in, so additional shielding will need to be placed around the feedthrough. The weight of this compact neutron source will be about \SI{140}{\kg}, so mounting will be simpler compared to Design A. The effective neutron flux is expected to be similar to that of Design A. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{dunefigure}[Pulsed neutron system neutron capture positions inside a \dword{dune}-sized TPC]{fig:PNS_NcapPosition}
{Neutron capture positions inside a \dword{dune}-sized \dword{tpc}. L=\SI{60}{\m} (along Z axis, horizontally parallel to the beam direction), W=\SI{14.5}{\m} (along X axis, horizontally perpendicular to the beam direction), H=\SI{10}{\m} (along Y axis, vertically perpendicular to the beam direction). The neutron moderator is based on Design A, but the entire source is placed inside the injection port central to the cryostat. \num{1e6} DD generator neutrons with \SI{2.5}{\MeV} energy were simulated in the moderator and propagated inside the liquid argon \dword{tpc}. Left: Top view of neutron capture positions. Right: Side view of neutron capture positions.}
\includegraphics[width=18cm]{PNS_NcapPosition.png}
%\includegraphics[width=10cm]{PNS_NcapPosition_v2.png}
\end{dunefigure}




The two designs were simulated in GEANT4. The position distribution of the neutron captures is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PNS_NcapPosition}. In the simulation, the \dlong{pns} is placed on top of the cryostat with the same size as the \dword{dune} \SI{10}{\kton} TPC. Initial simulation results indicate that one \dword{pns} could cover half the TPC volume, so two identical neutron sources, each located at the center of the each half of the cryostat
%each central to half the cryostat top,  %\todo{SG: I assume this is with design A, right? if so, mention which design}
would illuminate the whole TPC volume of the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} for both designs. However, this would require opening two additional neutron injection ports which are not included in the current cryostat design \footnote{Ideally, opening two identical neutron injection ports for each \SI{10}{\kton} TPC would make full use of the neutron source. The possibility requires further discussion with the cryostat engineers.}. Alternatively, two large format neutron sources (Design A) could be permanently deployed at the human access ports at the corners of the cryostat. One concern is that the neutrons scattered from the liquid argon volume from the human access ports may not reach the center of the TPC. This can be mitigated by using a small format neutron source (Design B) deployed on top at the center of the cryostat using the multi-purpose feedthroughs. %could be used to complement the coverage of the large format sources. 
Figure~\ref{fig:PNS_Energy_Moderator} shows the energy spectrum of the neutrons moderated and injected to the \dword{lartpc}, based on Design A.
% This figure is based on Design A moderator placed inside the manhole. We can still use this figure, because the energy spectrum shape should be same. Only the flux will be a factor of 6 lower
%The neutron energy is moderated from 2.5 MeV to below 100 keV.  

\begin{dunefigure}[Energy of moderated neutrons produced by the \dlong{pns}]{fig:PNS_Energy_Moderator}

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{PNS_Energy_Moderator.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

The system is expected to have a long lifetime of operation, but as the \dword{pns} system sits on top of the cryostat, with no opening to the liquid argon, it is possible to replace the system if it fails with only crane support.

\subsubsection{Measurement Program}
\label{sec:sp-calib-sys-pns-meas}

The \SI{6.1}{\MeV} $\gamma$ cascade will provide a uniform signal for neutron capture, part of the supernova signal. The source may also be used to determine the relative efficiency across the detector for neutron capture, and also provide measurements of energy resolution and energy scale spatially and temporally resolved. Simulation studies are currently underway.
%and for the second draft, we plan to include a first round of simulation results.

%\todo{Simulation studies are underway but changing rapidly. for v2 we will include a first round of studies.}

The first goal of the simulation is to provide the expected distribution of signals, with a normalization given by the pulse width of \dword{pns} operation, and the neutrons energy and angular correlated distribution, depending on the source filter and shield design which can also be used to optimize the calibration strategy.
%. It will be used to optimize the calibration strategy too. 
It is envisaged that the calibration can be done in two modes: first, a short \dword{pns} pulse can provide isolated neutron captures closer to the entrance path; and then a longer \dword{pns} pulse, for which the same region is saturated, but isolated neutrons captures can be obtained in the full volume.

By using an external trigger coupled to the \dword{pns} operation and running the usual trigger algorithms in parallel, the calibration will provide the efficiency of the trigger and DAQ systems as a function of total fluxes. Changing the pulse width can result in 
%resulting on 
higher or lower detector activity. The source will be used for \dword{snb} calibration to test
%, in the sense of testing 
the capabilities of triggering for low energy signals, but also 
%of identifying 
to identify them in different pile-up conditions.
The transmission of the global timing from the external \dword{pns} trigger to the DAQ provides a strong constraint on the initial timing for the \dword{tpc}
%Time Projection Chamber 
as the neutron capture times are of the order of 0.15~ms, much lower than typical drift time scale for the TPC. The photon detectors, with resolutions of 100~ns, can discriminate between different neutron captures. The calibration will measure the efficiency of the \dword{pds} response for low energy events, depending on the distance due to the Rayleigh scattering in Argon. We will then study the usage of the \dword{pds} time information for improving the position reconstruction of TPC signals. In their 
the absence of the \dword{pds} system, the global timing from the \dword{pns} translates to an uncertainty of around 10~cm.

Individual event positions can be translated into response maps of both the photon detectors and the \dword{lartpc} to standard candles of 6.1~MeV electromagnetic depositions. When the cascades can be more precisely reconstructed, individual gammas within the cascades can be identified, setting an even lower standard candle, close to the solar electron-neutrino thresholds. Comparing the collected charge for equal energy signals at difference distances from the TPC gives a measurement of the electron lifetime, the main response parameter. High \dword{pns} flux runs can generate momentary local space charge effects, in the 
%top parts 
upper regions of the detector, that will need to be characterized; low flux runs should be taken before to ensure 
%usual 
expected space charge distributions.
The global simulation will be tested in the (smaller scale) protoDUNE detectors. The neutron mean free path will be larger that the protoDUNE size, and so 
%there will be more 
external events and interactions with materials of the \dword{pds}, \dword{apa} and \dword{cpa} systems will be more prominent. These effects will need to be simulated.

%Notice 
Note that captures of external background neutrons, entering the active volume is a main background for low energy physics and it will be interesting to compare the simulation of the \dword{pns} events with that of external neutron backgrounds and of supernova and solar neutrino signals. For the high energy beam events, the number and energy distributions of neutrons depend on the interaction and are significantly different between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. A measurement of the number and distance of neutron captures around the main hadronic cascades can thus help in the identification of which extra proton scattering signals to associate to the hadronic cascades or in a statistical correction to the energy reconstruction of the neutrino and anti-neutrino events.
