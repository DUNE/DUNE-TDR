%\section{Institutional Responsibilities}
%\label{sec:sp-calib-resp}

%\fixme{SG/JM: Done. KM: take a look. More details in the email I sent. }
%Currently, the calibration consortium has the following member institutions: University of Bern (Bern), Boston University (BU), Colorado State University (CSU), University of California, Davis (UC Davis) University of Hawaii (Hawaii), University of Iowa (Iowa), LIP, Michigan State University (MSU), University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), South Dakota School of Mine Technology (SDSMT), and University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK). 

Calibrations %slow controls and cryogenic instrumentation 
will be a joint effort for \single and \dual. Design validation, testing, calibration, and performance of calibration devices will be evaluated using \dword{protodune} data.

Following the conceptual funding model for the consortium, various responsibilities have been distributed across institutions within the consortium. 
%At this stage of the project, these should be considered aspirational responsibilities until firm funding is established.
Table~\ref{tab:calib-inst-resp} shows the current institutional responsibilities for primary calibration subsystems. 
%Only lead institutes are listed in the table for a given effort. 
For physics and simulations studies and validation with \dword{protodune}, a number of institutions are interested. 
%A \dword{dune} DocDB will be prepared to provide a detailed list of tasks and corresponding institutional responsibilities.

%The responsibilities of each group are described in Table~\ref{tab:calibinst}. \fixme{Need to confirm this with groups, esp CSU, Pitt doing general simulation work and understand what further subdivision is useful. We are also seeking new groups.}
