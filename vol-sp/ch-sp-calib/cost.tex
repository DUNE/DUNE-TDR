%\todo{SG: need quantity for photoelectron laser in the table 1.6.} KM: Quantity added from Jelena.
Table \ref{tab:calib-cost} shows the current cost estimates for the calibration subsystems. It also shows the quantity associated with each subsystem and a brief description of what is included in the cost estimate. The cost estimates include only materials and supplies (M\&S) and packing and shipping, but not labor and travel costs. One \dword{sp} detector module requires \num{20} ports for the laser (see Figure~\ref{fig:calib-FTmap}); \num{14} ports will each need one laser and one feedthrough interface, but for the \num{6} ports central to the cryostat, one laser will service two ports. According to simulation studies, an \dword{sp} module requires two pulsed neutron systems.

Labor costs depend on personnel category (e.g., faculty, student, technician, post-doc, engineer) and vary by region and institution, so costs are quantified using labor hours needed to complete a given task. Table~\ref{tab:calib-labor} provides estimates of labor hours for each subsystem.
