%\subsubsection{Physics Motivation}

Radioactive source deployment provides an in-situ source of physics signals at a known location and with a known activity that can be chosen such that there is only one calibration event per drift time window. The baseline source design probes de-excitation products (gamma-rays) which are directly relevant for detection of supernova neutrinos and $^{8}B$/hep solar neutrinos. The \dlong{rsds} (\dshort{rsds}) is the only calibration system that could probe the detection capability for single isolated solar neutrino events and study how well radiological backgrounds can be suppressed. The trigger efficiency could be studied %versus 
as a function of threshold. 

Secondary measurements from the baseline source deployment include electro-magnetic (EM) shower characterization for long-baseline $\nu_e$ CC events, electron lifetime and electric field as a function of \dword{detmodule} vertical position, individual light detector response, and determination of radiative components of the Michel electron energy spectrum from muon decays. Aside from the baseline $^{58}$Ni(n,$\gamma$)$^{59}$Ni 9 MeV gamma-ray source, other sources could be deployed with the same multi-purpose system, for example a $^{40}$Ar($\alpha,\,\gamma$)$^{44}$Ca gamma-ray source, a $^{252}$Cf and/or AmBe neutron source that probe the impact of various radiological backgrounds, like radon ($\alpha,\,\gamma$) or radiological neutrons, or simply measure the neutron tagging efficiency, useful for improved calorimetry of beam neutrino interactions. In contrast to the baseline $^{58}$Ni(n,$\gamma$)$^{59}$Ni source with 9 MeV gamma-rays, a $^{40}Ar(\alpha,\,\gamma)^{44}$Ca source producing gamma-ray energies around 15~MeV could even be deployed outside of the cryostat and probing the upper visible energy range and trigger efficiency for $^{8}B$/hep solar neutrinos. 

Both the \dshort{rsds} and the pulsed neutron source system are needed to address the integrated response of the detector for low energy physics. 
The \dword{rsds} primarily probes for trigger efficiency, the \dword{pns} tests mostly for uniformity. Response in Ar may change rapidly as a function of photon energy due to underlying nuclear physics mechanisms. A combination of 6~MeV (direct neutron capture response), 9~MeV (peak visible $\gamma$-energy of interest to \dword{snb} and $^{8}B$/hep solar neutrinos), 15~MeV (upper visible energy of $^{8}B$/hep solar neutrinos) and decay electrons ($\sim$30~MeV) is needed to map the low energy response. In terms of complementarity, radioactive sources provide a known position, known-energy single photon events that could be triggered on, while the pulsed neutron source provides a simple, potentially, non-invasive design with externally triggered multi-photon energy signature which is visible across the entire detector with a known time signature.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Design Considerations}

A composite source can be used that consists  of $^{252}$Cf, a strong neutron emitter, and $^{58}$Ni, which, via the $^{58}$Ni(n,$\gamma$)$^{59}$Ni process, converts one of the $^{252}$Cf fission neutrons, suitably moderated, to a monoenergetic \SI{9}{\MeV} photon~\cite{Rogers:1996ks}. 
The source is envisaged to be inside a cylindrical moderator with mass of about \SI{15}{kg} and a diameter of \SI{20}{\cm} such that it can be deployed via the multipurpose instrumentation ports discussed in Section~\ref{sec:calib-ports}. The activity of the radioactive source is chosen such that no more than one \SI{9}{\MeV} capture $\gamma$-event occurs during a single drift period. This forms the main requirement for this system as this allows one to use the arrival time of the measured light as a $t0$ and then measure the average drift time of the corresponding charge signal(s). Table~\ref{tab:fdgen-calib-all-reqs-rsds} lists the full set of requirements for the \dlong{rsds}.

The sources would be deployed outside the \dword{fc} within the cryostat to avoid regions with a high electric field, about \SI{30}{\cm} from the field cage. The $\gamma$-ray would need to travel about two attenuation lengths (including the \SI{10}{\cm} radius of the source body). Such high $\gamma$-energies are typically only achieved by thermal neutron capture, which invokes a neutron source surrounded by a large
amount of moderator, thus making such an externally deployed (n, $\gamma$) source \SI{20}{\cm}  to \SI{50}{\cm} % large
in diameter.

%\cite{Triumf:Nickelsource} 
%\todo{SG: reference needs fixing},
a $^{58}$Ni (n,$\gamma$) source, triggered by an AmBe neutron source,
has been successfully built, yielding high $\gamma$-energies of \SI{9}{\MeV}. DUNE %We
proposes to use a $^{252}$Cf (or AmLi as backup) neutron source with lower
neutron energies, which requires less than half of the surrounding
moderator, and making the $^{58}$Ni (n, $\gamma$) source only
\SI{20}{\cm} or less in diameter. The multipurpose instrumentation
feedthroughs at either end of the cryostat are sufficient for
this, and have an inner diameter of \SI{25}{\cm}.  The moderator
material chosen for DUNE is Delrin,\footnote{DuPont\texttrademark Delrin\textregistered, \url{http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/plastics-polymers-resins/thermoplastics/brands/delrin-acetal-resin.html}.} which has a large enough
density to avoid flotation. Further, the end caps of the source
body are round to avoid distorting the electric field and to
eliminate the risk of the source getting stuck during deployment. 
Figure~\ref{fig:RadioactiveSource_zm40cm_xp220cm} depicts the baseline source design of a
cylindrical Delrin moderator with a diameter of \SI{20}{\cm}, a
height of \SI{40}{\cm} including half-spheres at either end with
radius of \SI{10}{\cm}, deployed at $z$=\SI{40}{\cm} leaving a gap of \SI{30}{\cm} towards the \dword{fc} and at a distance to the \dword{apa} of $x$=\SI{220}{\cm}, 
which is slightly further than mid-drift.

%\fixme{KM: From Juergen but I think covered by above: The activity of the radioactive source is chosen such that no more than one \SI{9}{\MeV} capture $\gamma$-ray spills into the active \dword{lartpc} region during a single \SI{2.2}{\milli\s} drift period. This allows one to use the arrival time of the measured light as $t_{0}$ and then measure the average drift time of the corresponding charge signal(s). The resulting drift velocity in turn yields the electric field strength, averaged over the variations encountered during the drifting of the charge(s). This can be repeated for each single \SI{9}{\MeV} capture $\gamma$-event that occurs during a \SI{2.2}{\milli\s} drift period and where visible $\gamma$-energy is deposited inside the active volume of the TPC.

 for the Double Chooz
reactor neutrino experiment has become available for DUNE after
the decommissioning of Double Chooz in 2018. The system can be
easily refitted for use in DUNE. The system will be housed inside
a purge-box that is connected via a neck to a multipurpose
calibration feedthrough with a closed gate valve on top of the
cryostat. Before deployments, the source will be gently cooled-down by blowing liquid argon boil-off onto it inside a sealed purge-box. After the source has reached 
%near liquid argon 
near-\dword{lar} temperatures, the purge-box will be evacuated by a vacuum pump to remove any residual oxygen and nitrogen which is monitored at the ppm level. Then, the entire purge-box interior is purged with boil-off liquid argon, and the pressure equalized with the gas pressure inside the detector, before the gate-valve is opened and deployments can commence. This procedure ensures that no significant impurities are introduced into the detector during a deployment and that no significant amount of liquid argon is boiled-off from the detector. 
%Also, if the source is in close proximity of an \dword{apa} wire frame, lower energetic radiological backgrounds become problematic as the source light and charge yield is reduced exponentially with distance. 

Deployed near mid-drift (in each TPC module) the \SI{9}{\MeV}
$\gamma$-ray source can illuminate the full drift length from
\dword{apa} to \dword{cpa}. The sources are retrieved from the
detector after each deployment and stored outside the cryostat following approved safety protocols, and the gate-valves are kept closed after deployments. More details on radiation safety and handling procedures are presented in Section~\ref{sec:sp-calib-rsds-safety}.

\subsubsection{Development Plan}
The major development plans for the \dlong{rsds} include
\begin{itemize}
\item Continued development of relevant simulation tools including geometry representation of the source deployment system and impact from various radiological contaminants on detector response. 
\item Studies to suppress radiological backgrounds for the calibration source.
\item Simulation studies to understand data and trigger rates.
\item A baseline design source with Delrin moderator, $^{252}$Cf neutron source, and natural nickel target, both sealed inside at the moderator's center.
\item Validation of \SI{9}{\MeV} capture $\gamma$-ray yield of source using spectroscopic measurements with the `RABBIT' germanium detector at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, that has an assay chamber large enough to fit the bulky moderator. 
%\fixme{Check this please. SG: check what?}
\item Validation with $^{3}$He based hodoscope at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology to ensure that the flux of neutrons escaping the moderator is not an issue; otherwise use lower energetic AmLi neutron source instead and/or more moderator material, and/or different geometric configuration of nickel target. 
\item Test gentle GAr cooling of source and validate material integrity. Measure tensile strength of braided SS-304 wire-rope at cryogenic temperatures and ensure a safety factor of one order of magnitude by adjusting number of steel braids and their diameters. Validate cryogenic shrinkage of sectional teflon sleeves, that enclose the braided steel wire-rope and electrically insulate it towards the \dword{fc}. 
\item Validation that anticipated fluid flow in \dword{lar} does not cause oscillations of the source; otherwise design vertical guide wires to be pre-installed during detector installation 
%and that they 
which will keep source in stable position during deployment along the vertical axis.
%\item A mechanical test of the Double Chooz fish-line deployment system with both an \dword{lar} and liquid nitrogen mock-up column in the high bay lab at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. The ultimate test of the system will be done at ProtoDUNE. 
\item Explore other radioactive sources beyond the baseline $^{58}$Ni(n,$\gamma$)$^{59}$Ni 9 MeV gamma-ray source, for example a non-invasive externally employed $^{40}$Ar($\alpha,\,\gamma$)$^{44}$Ca 15~MeV gamma-ray source with $^{241}$Am that is currently being assembled at SDSMT, and that could probe from the outside of the cryostat the upper visible energy range and trigger efficiency for $^{8}B$/hep solar neutrinos. Furthermore, investigate hybrid neutron sources ($^{252}$Cf and AmBe) that emulate the kinetic neutron energy spectrum of radiological neutrons and probe the neutron tagging efficiency, useful for improved calorimetry of beam neutrino interactions and for clarification of impact of radiological neutron backgrounds.

\subsubsection{Measurement Program}
\label{sec:sp-calib-sys-src-dep-meas}

The proposed baseline 9~MeV single $\gamma$ source may also be used to test the $\gamma$ aspect of the \dword{snb} and $^{8}B$/hep solar neutrino signal along the full drift but only in the endwall regions of the detector. The source may also be used to determine the relative charge and light extraction efficiency in the vertical direction for measurements of energy resolution and energy scale. 

%SG: this is repetition
%The \dword{rsds} is the only calibration system that could probe the detection capability for single isolated solar neutrino events and study how well radiological backgrounds can be suppressed. 
Figure~\ref{fig:rsds-fig1}
%{fig:9MeVgamma_withBG_LArSoft_v08_14_00_hiLY_originCHARGEcollected_TopView}
depicts in a top view of the detector the simulated charge extraction efficiency for the baseline $^{58}$Ni(n,$\gamma$)$^{59}$Ni 9~MeV $\gamma$-ray source deployed \SI{40}{\cm} outside of the \dword{fc}, near mid-drift i.e., \SI{220}{\cm} away from the \dword{apa} in the $x$ direction, in the presence of expected background before (Fig.~\ref{fig:rsds-fig1}(a)) and after (Fig.~\ref{fig:rsds-fig1}(b)) applying selection cuts. The selection cuts discard each collection wire hit with less than 90~ADCU, limit wire hits to be within the width of the outer \dword{apa}, use induction wire hits to discard collection wire hits occurring further than \SI{2.2}{\m} away from the vertical deployment height, and requiring at least one occurrence per \SI{2.2}{\ms} drift-time window of a simultaneously extracted number of photoelectrons of more than 40~pes (within a \SI{50}{\ns} time window).
Figure~\ref{fig:rsds-fig1}(b)
%Figure~\ref{fig:9MeVgamma_withBG_LArSoft_v08_14_00_hiLY_originCHARGEcollected_TopView} (b) 
demonstrates that the selection cuts can reject charge from radiological backgrounds almost entirely, such that almost pure 9~MeV gamma-ray events are selected. Thus, the baseline \dword{rsds} would allow the trigger efficiency for isolated solar neutrino events to be studied, and even its dependence on the applied threshold measured. 

%SG: already stated under physics motivation, no need to repeat
%Moreover, the small electronic pulses from 9~MeV gamma-ray induced charge and light collections can be utilized to better characterize electro-magnetic (EM) showers for long-baseline $\nu_e$ CC events, as well as to determine the radiative components of the Michel electron energy spectrum from muon decays. 
%Further secondary measurements from the baseline 9 MeV gamma-ray source deployment include measuring the electron lifetime and electric field as a function of \dword{detmodule} vertical position, as well as the individual light detector response. 

Figure~\ref{fig:rsds-fig2}
%{9MeVgamma_withBG_LArSoft_v08_14_00_hiLY_DriftTimesEfield_ChargeSpectrumElectronLifetime_cut} 
shows exemplary simulated baseline \dword{rsds} measurements of the electric field strength (Fig.~\ref{fig:rsds-fig2}(a)) and of the electron lifetime (Fig.~\ref{fig:rsds-fig2}(b)), each for three different scenarios. The time difference between an extracted number of photoelectrons of more than 40~pes and the recorded hit times on collection wires, passing the selection cuts, defines the plotted drift-times. Precise quantities can be extracted from fitting the measured drift-time distribution to the simulation. For this, the simulated collection wire charge (before selection cuts) is re-weighted with respect to 
%(a) 
the electric field strength, and 
%(b) 
the electron lifetime, respectively. After each re-weighting of the simulation the selection cuts are then applied. Figure~\ref{fig:rsds-fig2}(a)
%{9MeVgamma_withBG_LArSoft_v08_14_00_hiLY_DriftTimesEfield_ChargeSpectrumElectronLifetime_cut} (a) 
illustrates that with this method the electric field strength could be measured at $\sim 1\%$ precision at each vertical deployment position at the endwalls. Likewise, Figure~\ref{fig:rsds-fig2}(b)
%Figure~\ref{9MeVgamma_withBG_LArSoft_v08_14_00_hiLY_DriftTimesEfield_ChargeSpectrumElectronLifetime_cut} (b) 
illustrates that the electron lifetime could be measured at few $\%$ precision at each vertical deployment position at the endwalls. 

Figure~\ref{fig:rsds-fig2}(c)
%{9MeVgamma_withBG_LArSoft_v08_14_00_hiLY_DriftTimesEfield_ChargeSpectrumElectronLifetime_cut} (c) 
illustrates that with a recorded charge spectrum (after selection cuts) it is not convincingly possible to unambiguously measure both the electron lifetime and the electric field strength. Both parameters for most part simply shift the upper falling edge of the charge spectrum further up or down. However, at each vertical \dword{rsds} deployment position at the endwalls, it is still possible to self-consistently measure both the electron lifetime and the electric field strength at $\sim 1\%$ precision: First, the electric field strength is precisely inferred from the drift-time distribution at each deployment position, second the corresponding electron lifetime is then precisely deduced from the charge distribution by using the measured electric field strength as precise constraint. 

Figure~\ref{fig:rsds-fig2plus} visualizes the simulated change of individual light detector response as a function of \dword{detmodule} vertical position when the baseline source is deployed at one of the possible endwall locations. The uniformity of the optical detection response can be probed with a full vertical scan. Wrong channel mapping, dead or noisy optical detectors could be easily identified. 

Aside from the baseline $^{58}$Ni(n,$\gamma$)$^{59}$Ni 9 MeV $\gamma$-ray source, other sources could be deployed with the same multi-purpose system, for example a $^{40}$Ar($\alpha,\,\gamma$)$^{44}$Ca gamma-ray source, a $^{252}$Cf and/or AmBe neutron source that probe the impact of various radiological backgrounds, like radon ($\alpha,\,\gamma$) or radiological neutrons, or simply measure the neutron tagging efficiency, useful for improved calorimetry of beam neutrino interactions. 

In contrast to the baseline $^{58}$Ni(n,$\gamma$)$^{59}$Ni source with 9~MeV $\gamma$-rays, a \argon40$(\alpha,\,\gamma)^{44}$Ca source producing $\gamma$-ray energies around \SI{15}{MeV} could even be deployed outside of the cryostat and probing the upper visible energy range and trigger efficiency for $^{8}B$/hep solar neutrinos. Figure~\ref{fig:rsds-fig3}
%{5MeValphaSource_zx_TDR_TopView} 
shows in a top view of the detector the widely spread interaction locations of about half a dozen $^{40}Ar(\alpha,\,\gamma)^{44}$Ca 15 MeV $\gamma$-ray events in terms of detected light (Fig.~\ref{fig:rsds-fig3}(a)) and  detected charge (Fig.~\ref{fig:rsds-fig3}(b)). These simulation plots depict that 15~MeV $\gamma$-rays can travel \SI{7}{\m} in liquid argon, i.e., about half the width and half the height of the detector. It is therefore possible to deploy such a \argon40$(\alpha,\,\gamma)^{44}$Ca \SI{15}{MeV} $\gamma$-ray source conveniently and non-invasive from the outside of the cryostat, from each side and from the top (assuming that underneath the cryostat there is no accessible space). This would allow for calibrating large parts of the full detector with this source. 

An external \dword{protodune} deployment can demonstrate the feasibility of the non-invasive \argon40$(\alpha,\,\gamma)^{44}$Ca \SI{15}{MeV} $\gamma$-ray source despite the lack of overburden to shield cosmic rays. In contrast to cosmic muons, \SI{15}{MeV} $\gamma$-ray induced hit clusters will start inside the detector volume, and are not tracks that begin at the detector edges. Thus, the \dword{rsds} calibration events could therefore be easily selected and the detected charge can be analyzed. The detected light, however, will be obscured from the high light level in each drift period from cosmic muons hitting \dword{protodune}.

\subsubsection{\dword{rsds} Design Validation}
\dword{protodune} forms the ultimate test to validate the design, operation and performance of the system. The cosmic induced background rate at \dword{protodune} is too high at the surface to detect responses to the \dword{dune} gamma source; a higher intensity source could be deployed to test the detector response and analysis method. However, tests of functionality,  reliability, and safety of the mechanical deployment system are needed to show the source can be deployed and retrieved with no issues.

\subsubsection{DAQ Requirements}
Section~\ref{sec:sp-calib-daqreq} provides an overall discussion of the Calibration and \dword{daq} interface. Here, the \dword{daq} requirements for the \dlong{rsds} are discussed. The radioactive source will not be triggerable by the \dword{mlt}.  Rather, it will deliver a tag to the \dword{mlt} and that tag will include a time stamp that can be used by the \dword{mlt} to issue a trigger command to the \dword{fe} readout.  The trigger command will have a standard readout window size of \SI{5.4}{\milli\s}, but to keep data rates manageable, the command will only be send to \dword{fe} readout buffers that are expected to be illuminated by the source. The localization of trigger commands thus reduces the data volume by \num{150}, if only one \dword{apa} is read out.

Nevertheless, if the rate of such a source is anywhere close to one per \SI{5.4}{\milli\s}, the detector would be running  continuously in the current scheme. Therefore we assume that the interaction rate in the detector is \SI{10}{\hertz} or less. The tag from the source will likely be much higher than this, because not all $\gamma$s interact in the active \dword{tpc} volume. Thus the radioactive source trigger will be a coincidence in the Module-Level Trigger between a low-energy trigger candidate from the illuminated \dword{apa}, and a source tag with a relevant time stamp.  With this rate, and with localization of events to one \dword{apa}, the total data volume would be

\begin{equation}
\num{8}~{\rm hours} \times \num{4}~{\rm FTs} \times \SI{10}{\hertz} \times \num{1.5}~{\rm Bytes}\times \SI{2}{\mega\hertz}\times \SI{5.4}{\milli\s}\times \num{2560}~{\rm channels} = \num{50}~{\rm TB/scan}.
\end{equation}

Running this calibration four times/year would yield \num{200}~TB of data in \SI{10}{\kt} per year.

\subsubsection{Risks}
The risks associated with the radioactive source system are described in Table~\ref{tab:risks:SP-FD-CAL-RSDS} along with appropriate mitigation strategies and the impact (low, medium or high risk levels) on probability, cost, and schedule post-mitigation.

10 & The deployed radioactive source can potentially swing into detector elements if not controlled or if large currents exist in the \dword{lar} & M & Guide-wires mitigate this risk.\\ \colhline

11 & Radioactivity could leak into the detector during a deployment. & L & Rigorous source certification under large pressure and cryogenic temperatures mitigates this risk.\\ \colhline

Light-tight purge-box, internally equipped with an infra-red camera for visual checks will mitigate this risk.\\ \colhline

\subsubsection{Installation, Integration, and Commissioning}
The first elements of the radioactive source guide system are installed before the \dword{tpc} elements on the end wall farthest from the \dword{tco} and as the last system, concurrent and coordinated with the alternative laser system (if any deployed), once the \dword{tpc} is installed before closing the \dword{tco}. The radioactive source deployment system is installed at the top of the cryostat and can be installed when \dword{dune} becomes operational.

The commissioning plan for the source deployment system will include a dummy source deployment (within 2 months of the commissioning) followed by first real source deployment (within 3 to 4 months of the commissioning) and a second real source deployment (within 6 months of the commissioning). Assuming stable detector conditions, the radioactive source will be deployed every half a year. Ideally, a deployment before and after a run period are desired so at least two data points are available for calibration. This also provides a check if the state of the system
has changed before and after the physics data run.
%If stability fluctuates for any reason (e.g., electronic response changes over time) at a particular location, one would want to deploy the source at that location once a month, or more often, depending on how bad the stability is.
It is estimated that it will take a few hours (e.g. 8 hours) to deploy the system at one feedthrough location and a full radioactive source calibration campaign might take %at least 
a week.

\subsubsection{Quality Control}
A mechanical test of the Double Chooz fish-line deployment system with an \dword{lar} mock-up column will be done in the high bay laboratory at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. The ultimate test of the system will be done at \dword{protodune}. Safety checks will also be done for the source and for appropriate storage on the surface and underground. 

\subsubsection{Safety}
\label{sec:sp-calib-rsds-safety}
A composite source is used for the radioactive source system that consists  of \isotope{Cf}{252}, a strong neutron emitter, and \isotope{Ni}{58}, which, via the \isotope{Ni}{58}(n,$\gamma$)\isotope{Ni}{59} process, converts one of the \isotope{Cf}{252} fission neutrons, suitably moderated, to a monoenergetic \SI{9}{\MeV} gamma. This system also poses a radiation risk, which will be mitigated with a purge-box for handling, and a shielded storage box and an area with lockout-tagout procedures, also applied to the gate-valve on top of the cryostat. Material safety data sheets will be submitted to DUNE ES\&H and specific procedures will be developed for storage and handling of sources to meet FRCM requirements. These procedures will be reviewed and approved by SURF and Fermilab radiation safety officers. Sources that get deployed will be checked monthly to ensure they are not leaking. A designated shielded storage area will be assigned for sources and proper handling procedures will be reviewed periodically. A custodian will be assigned to each shielded source.
