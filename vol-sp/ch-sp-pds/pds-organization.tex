The single-phase photon detector consortium has and will continue to benefit from the contributions of many institutions and facilities in Europe and North and South America.  Tables~\ref{tab:sp-pds-institutes-i} and \ref{tab:sp-pds-institutes-ii} list the member institutions. 
%To help guide the interactions of these many contributors, the consortium is divided into six working groups, each with two or three conveners, to direct its activities.  % The structure of the organization is detailed below.

The \single \dword{pds} consortium follows the typical organizational structure of DUNE consortia:
\begin{itemize}
\item A consortium lead provides overall leadership for the effort, and attends meetings of the DUNE Executive and Technical Boards.
\item A technical lead provides technical support to the consortium lead, attends the Technical Board and other project meetings, oversees the project schedule and \dword{wbs}, and oversees the operation of the project working groups.  
%In the case of the \dword{pds}, the technical lead is supported by a deputy technical lead.
\end{itemize}

%{\dword{pds} consortium organization chart.}

%	\includegraphics[angle=90,height=12cm]{pds-consortium-org-chart}
	
%\end{dunefigure} 

Below the leadership, the consortium is divided up into six working groups, each led by two or three working group conveners.  Each working group is charged with one primary area of responsibility within the consortium, and the conveners report directly to the technical lead regarding those responsibilities. %As the consortium advances to a more detailed \dword{wbs} and project schedule, it is envisioned that each working group will be responsible for one section of those documents.

The working group conveners are appointed by the \dword{pds} Consortium Lead and Technical Lead; the structure may evolve as the consortium matures and additional needs are identified.

%\subsection{Project Planning Assumptions}
%\label{sec:fdsp-pd-org-assmp}

%\fixme{I think this sub-section is redundant and can be removed.  It is all still here if you want to resurrect it.}
%\metainfo{\color{blue} Content: Segreto/Warner}

%Plans for the \dword{pds} consortium are based on the overall schedule for the DUNE \dword{fd}. In particular, the \dword{apa} schedule defines the time window for the completion of the final development program for the light collectors: A final down-select to a baseline light collector option and \dword{fe} electronics has been made for the TDR.  Due to the opportunities presented by our new Italian colleagues and their close connection with FBK, we may maintain an alternate photosensor option up to the pre-production review in September of 2020, but all other systems must be defined prior to the \dword{tdr}.

%The \dword{pds} modules will undergo final assembly and testing at the \dword{pds} assembly facility at UNICAMP, with an initial  assembly rate of approximately twenty modules per week, accelerating to forty modules per week in the second half of module fabrication.  

%The modules will be shipped from the fabrication facilities to the project storage facility, 
%to be integrated along with the \dword{ce} into the \dword{apa} frames and cold tested in a cryogenic test facility.  We plan for an initial rate of two \dwords{apa} per week, with the possibility of accelerating to four \dwords{apa} per week as production lessons are learned.  \Dword{pds} personnel will be present at the integration facility to oversee the installation and testing.

%Meeting this timeline requires that the development of the ARAPUCA system be aggressively pursued throughout 2018, with a goal of testing near-final prototypes in the late fall of 2018 and allowing technology comparisons between the ARAPUCA and the light guide technologies in winter of 2019.

%Additional development efforts will focus on:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item identifying and selecting reliable cryogenic photosensor (\dword{sipm}) candidates,
%\item reducing cost and optimizing performance of \dword{fe} electronics, and 
%\item solidifying \dword{pds} performance requirements from additional physics simulation efforts.
%\end{itemize}

%We assume that apart from these items, where rapid development is still required, most of the detector components to be delivered by the \dword{pd} consortium will require only minor changes relative to the \dword{pdsp} components. For this reason, modifications of these other detector components will be delayed until 2019, which will also help with the funding profile. Exceptions will be made for further development in test stands with regard to cabling studies, and for the interface engineering required to ensure satisfactory integration of the \dword{pd} with the \dword{apa} and \dword{ce}  systems.

\subsection{High-Level Cost Summary}

%\fixme{New cost table template to come early April. Anne}

\forlbnc{Note to reviewers:  This section is a placeholder - costs will be inserted prior to submission of the final revision in July.}

In the fall of 2018 we completed an initial cost estimate for fabrication of \dword{pd} modules for one 10kt \dword{dune} detector.  The estimates were based on ProtoDUNE costs, modified as necessary for an \dword{xarapu} design.  Vendor quotations or vendor estimates were used for most of the major components.  The biggest uncertainties in fabrication costs center around the photosensor fabrication, which currently constitute approximately half the total PD system cost.  We have estimates from Hamamatsu for photosensors which would reduce this line by nearly a factor of two, significantly reducing the system cost.  We also have preliminary indications that similar cost savings may also be available from using FBK photosensors.  As noted earlier in this \dword{tdr}, a major focus of our remaining development work centers is focused on realizing these potential savings.

The dichroic filter procurement and coating represent the other major cost driver for the project.  The costing for the filter plates is based on initial contacts with a Brazilian filter firm, but samples of these filters were recently procured and we are currently awaiting results from coating tests.   These filter plates are very significantly cheaper than the filters manufactured by Omega Inc. and tested in our earlier validation studies.  Until these tests are complete, the filter plates remain a significant cost and schedule risk.
