\section{Calibration Overview}
\label{sec:sp-calib-overview}

This section focuses on the general aspects of calibrations in \dword{dune}: the scope of the consortium activities and %proposed 
planned systems; the physics and performance requirements driving the design; and the overall strategy for usage of the systems, in combination with natural sources.
