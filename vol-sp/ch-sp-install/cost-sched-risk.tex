\section{Schedule}
\label{sec:sp-inst-sched}

The detector installation planning hinges on the date that the \dword{jpo} is permitted to begin work underground. According to the \dword{dune} \dword{cf} schedule, the \dword{jpo} receives the \dword{aup} for  the north cavern and \dword{cuc} in \cucbenocc{}.  The  \dword{sdwf} will be in place approximately six months before the warm structure installation begins, i.e., in spring 2022. Building the schedule for the \dword{detmodule} \#1 installation after \dword{aup} is  complicated and depends on many entities including \dword{cf}, \dword{lbnf}, and \dword{sdsta}.  The maximum number of people allowed underground is 144, which 
is based a one-hour time limit to evacuate all the underground personnel using all available paths.  As a backup, 
the  underground refuge must have capacity to accommodate this number of people. 
This number places a hard bound on how much work can be performed underground at any time and is particularly critical during the excavation of the third cavern when \dword{cf} is still active. Figure~\ref{fig:Overview-of-SinglePhase-Schedule} shows the main activities for the \dword{detmodule} \#1 installation and  the high-level milestones are shown in Table~\ref{tab:sp-iic-sched}.

The cost, schedule, and labor estimates are based on two \SI{10}{hour} shifts per day, four days a week (Monday through Thursday). Work efficiency should be a maximum of \SI{70}{\%}.  The cage ride, shift meetings, lunch, coffee breaks, and cleanroom gowning takes %up approximately 2-3 
up to three hours per day. Some low level of effort is planned on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to monitor the \coldbox{}es and take data.

We have defined three schedule phases for installation of the first \dword{spmod}:

\begin{itemize}

   \item {\bf \dword{cuc} Installation Phase:}
    This period,described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tc-inst-CUC}, starts once \dword{aup} has been received for the north cavern and the \dword{cuc}. This is the same time that excavation of the south cavern and installation of the warm structure by \dword{lbnf} begins. Since the \dwords{fte} underground is limited to 144 at a time, access will be minimal for \dword{dune} personnel and their work will only take place inside the \dword{cuc} and surface dataroom. Installing the basic rack infrastructure in the dataroom will take an estimated three months. Installation and testing of the \dword{daq} (required at the start of detector installation) will continue over the next 12 month period. Ten \dword{daq} workers are planned on each shift in this period.
     
 
   
    \item {\bf Installation Setup Phase:}  Described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tc-inst-setup}, this period includes installation of  the majority of the infrastructure. The setup phase is a critical training period, so getting lead workers, riggers, and equipment operators familiar with the tasks is a priority, as is  adjusting the crews to ensure balanced teams. The training process will have begun already at \dword{ashriver}. 
    There are many parallel underground activities planned in this phase making it a difficult phase to schedule, and frequent schedule adjustments may be required. Immediately after the cryostat warm structure is complete the north-south bridge is constructed. Following this the bridge crane under the bridge can be installed. A few months after the cryostat warm structure is complete the \dword{cf} work will also complete. Eighty of the 144 underground workers will become available to the \dword{jpo}, and the \dword{uit} team doubles in size. The \dword{jpo} will start two \SI{10}{hour} shifts per day.  Due to space constraints, peripheral work only on the cleanroom structure and assembly towers can begin. Once the  cryostat cold structure is approximately six months into its installation schedule, most of the foam will have been installed and floor space becomes available in the north cavern. The \coldbox construction must begin immediately at this point because the welding takes approximately six months. In parallel, the machine shop area can be set up. As the membrane installation nears completion, the walls of the cleanroom can be installed as can the remaining equipment. 
    
    Installation of the \dword{dss} could begin during the final installation stages of the cryostat cold structure because they both require full-height scaffolding for the welding on the top of the cryostat. The \dword{pdsp} \dword{dss} was installed this way. This requires a crew on top of the cryostat installing the \dword{dss} support feedthroughs from the top, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:install-dss-feedthru}.  The details have not yet been worked out with the contractor, and work may be done in stages.

   
    \item {\bf Detector Installation Phase:} The final detector installation phase begins with an \dword{orr} to check that all documentation and procedures are in place. After the east \dwords{ewfc} are installed, a start-up period of 1.5 months begins for the first two rows of \dword{tpc} components.  To meet this schedule, three assembly lines, three \coldbox{}es, and separate crews in the cryostat, all working in parallel, are needed.  It will take 5.5 months to install rows 3 through 24 and about one month for row 25. Closing the \dword{tco} will take approximately two months for the cryostat cold structure contractor; during this time, there is no access to the cryostat.  Once this is completed, we can complete the final instrumentation, and the purge can begin. During this period, up to 50 people will be working in the cleanroom and cryostat.
    
\end{itemize}

The total time to install the detector including the time for the setup phase is two years. Coincidentally, this was roughly the time needed to install \dword{minos} and \dword{nova}.
