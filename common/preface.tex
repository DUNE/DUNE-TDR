\section*{A Roadmap of the DUNE Technical Design Report}

The \dword{dune} \dword{tdr} describes the proposed physics program,  
detector designs, and management structures and procedures at the technical design stage.  

The TDR is composed of five volumes, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Volume~\volnumberexec{}, \voltitleexec{} provides an overview of all of DUNE suitable for science policy professionals.

\item Volume~\volnumberphysics{}, \voltitlephysics{}, describes the DUNE physics program.

\item Volumes~\volnumbersp{}, \voltitlesp{}, and ~\volnumberdp{}, \voltitledp{}, describe the two \dword{fd} \dword{lartpc} technologies, \dword{sp} and \dword{dp}.


\item Volume~\volnumbertc{}, \voltitletc{} outlines DUNE management structures and methodologies.  
\end{itemize}

Each volume contains a glossary to help the reader with DUNE terminology.
