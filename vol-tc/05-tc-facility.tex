\section{Detector Caverns Cryostats and Cryogenics}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-faci-caverns}

The underground facilities for the detectors consist of two parallel
detector caverns and one central utility cavern between them. The long
direction of the caverns is aligned approximately in the east-west
direction. Therefore, the two detector caverns are named north and
south caverns. Figure~\ref{fig:dune-underground} shows the overall
underground campus.
\begin{dunefigure}[Underground campus]{fig:dune-underground}

\end{dunefigure}

Each detector caverns is \SI{144.5}{meter} long \SI{19.8}{meter} wide
\SI{27.95}{meter} high and will house two detector modules, one on the
west side and one on the east side. In between the two detector
modules in one cavern, there is a \SI{12}{meter} space which will be
used for access and for cryogenic distribution pumps. There are access
tunnels east and west ends of each cavern, north and sought side of
north cavern and north side of south cavern.

The central utility cavern (CUC) \SI{190}{meter} long \SI{19.3}{meter}
wide \SI{10.95}{meter} high and will house cryogenic equipment, DAQ
room, and all mechanical and electrical services for all four
detectors.

Each detector is housed inside a cryostat. Each cryostat is made from
outside to inside of: an external steel structure, a warm membrane
plate, insulation and a cold membrane. Figure~\ref{fig:dune-cryostat}
shows the overall construction. The cryostat will have a vertical
opening at one end which will allow installation of detector
components. The opening will be closed after completion of
installation and prior to filling.

\end{dunefigure}

The detector cryogenics system supplies liquid Argon and provides
circulation, re-condensation and purification. The cryogenic system
components are housed inside the CUC, on top of each detector module
and between detector modules.

The underground facilities also include all the infrastructure and
utilities required for detector construction and operation.

\section{Detector Grounding}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-faci-grounding}

A detector grounding strategy has been adopted which will provide the
detector with an independent isolated ground to minimize any
environmental electrical noise which can couple into the detector
electronics either conductively or through emitted electromagnetic
interference.

The detectors will be located at the 4850 level of the Sanford
Underground Research Facility. The electrical conductivity of the
various rock masses are unknown but expected to have extremely poor
and inconsistent conductive properties. To insure adequate sensitivity
of the detectors, a special ground system must be put in place that
will isolate the detectors from all other electrical systems and
equipment, minimize the influence of inductive and capacitive coupling
and eliminate ground loops. The objective of the grounding
infrastructure requirements is to reduce or eliminate ground currents
through the detector which will affect detector sensitivity, maintain
a low impedance current path for equipment short circuit and ground
fault currents, and insure personnel safety by limiting
equipment-to-equipment and equipment-to-ground touch potentials.

Three basic ground structures have been identified which effect the
construction of the caverns.  These are shown in Figure XXX (include
SURF drawing showing grounding structures). These include:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Cavern ground which consists of overlapping welded wire mesh
   supported by rock bolts and covered with shotcrete. The \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune}
   Cavern ground includes all walls and crown areas above the 4850
   level in the North and South detector caverns and their associated
   central access drifts, plus tin-plated copper bus bars specified to
   run the length of the detector vessels on each side along the
   cavern walls and mounted external to the shotcrete.  The Cavern
   ground structure:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Spans the full length of the cavern from the West end access
   drift entrance through the mid-chamber to the East end access drift
   entrance.
 \item Spans the full width of the cavern from the 4850 level sill
   (top of the detector vessels and mid-chamber floor) on both sides
   up and across the crown of the cavern.
 \item Includes mid chamber walls to the 4910 level.
 \item Includes the east and west end walls of the cavern, from the 4850 level to the crown.
\end{enumerate}

 \item Ufer ground which consists of the metal rebar embedded in the
   concrete floors. The \dword{lbnf}/\dword{dune} Ufer ground system includes the
   concrete floors in the cavern mid-chambers, center access drifts,
   and central utility cavern. The cavern and Ufer grounds will be
   electrically well bonded to construct a single facilities ground
   which will be isolated from detector ground.

 \item Detector ground consists of the steel containment vessel
   enclosing the cryostat and all metal structures attached to or
   supported by the detector vessel.
\end{enumerate}

To maintain safety, a safety ground consisting of one or more
saturated inductors will be implemented between the detector ground
and the electrically bonded Ufer and cavern grounds.  Figure xxx (show
simplified detector grounding scheme), illustrates the implementation
of the safety ground. These safety ground inductors saturate with flux
under low-frequency high currents and present minimal impedance to
that current.  Thus, an AC power fault current will be shunted to the
facility ground and provide a safe grounding design. At higher
frequencies and lower currents, such as coupled noise currents, the
inductor provides an impedance to this current and thus restricts its
flow between grounded metal structures. The desired total impedance
between the detector ground structure and the cavern/UFER ground
structure is a minimum of 10 ohms at 10 MHz.

\section{Data Fibers}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-faci-fibers}

The \dword{dune} experiment has a requirement for a total of sixty-six fiber
optic pairs which run between the surface and the underground.  A
total of 96 fiber pairs, which includes both \dword{dune} and conventional
facility needs, will be supplied through redundant paths with bundles
coming down both the Ross and the Yates shafts.

The experiment has requested a total of fifteen data fiber pairs and
one slow control pair per detector for a total of sixty-four.  Another
two pairs are reserved for GPS.

These fibers are specified to work at 100 Gbps and meet or exceed the
G.652 standard.

\section{Central Utility Cavern Control and DAQ Rooms}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-cuc-daq}

The Central Underground Cavern (CUC) contains the DAQ and control
rooms for the \dword{dune} experiment.  Both rooms are located in the east
area of the CUC as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-cuc}.  The size and
suggested outfitting of the rooms can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-daq}.

\end{dunefigure}

The Control Room is primarily viewed as a meeting or work space where
five to ten people can sit with laptops during system commissioning.
It is not, as its name implies, a Control Room from which the
experiment will be run.  It also provides the required work space for
the cryogenic systems monitoring.  The cryogenic team requires a
footprint of two racks and two work benches for technicians who are
monitoring cryogenic systems.
       
The DAQ room will contain a minimum of 52 racks which will be used for
fiber optic cable distribution, networking, \dword{dune} DAQ, and the
requirements of conventional facilities.  A minimum of 48 racks are
reserved exclusively for DAQ.  Conventional facilities supply the DAQ
room with a tap to cooling water, an 18” raised floor, lighting,
HVAC, dry fire protection and 500KVA available power.  Technical
coordination will be responsible for the final outfitting and layout
of the room.  This includes the layout and installation of water
cooled racks, the design and installation of the cooling water piping
to the racks, the AC power distribution to the racks, and installation
of cable trays.



\section{Surface Rooms}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-surf-rooms}

The \dword{dune} experiment will utilize three surface rooms --- a Surface
Control Room, a DAQ Surface Computer Room, and a Facilities Room.

The \dword{dune} Surface Control Room is provided as a host lab
responsibility.  It will be used to commission, monitor and run the
experiment.  This may be a facility which includes shared space with
other experiments taking place at the Sanford Underground Research
Facility.

The DAQ consortia requires a Surface Computer room which will have a
quantity of eight racks and a minimum of 50kVA of power.  Connection
to the optical fibers running through the Ross and Yates shafts as
well as to ESNET will be required.

The Facilities Room is located in the basement of the Ross surface
building.  It will host both the FNAL provided network and
distribution racks for the fibers which run underground. Some details
of this room can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-surf-control}.

\section{\dword{dune} Detector Safety System (DDSS)}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-det-safety}

The \dword{dune} Detector Safety System (DDSS) functions to protect
experimental equipment.  The DDSS is required to detect abnormal and
potentially harmful operating conditions.  It must recognize when
conditions are not within the bounds of normal operating parameters
and automatically take pre-defined protective actions.

The DDSS must communicate to the Facility Information Reporting Utility
System (FIRUS) and the Slow Controls System which monitors the
detector status.  Through communication links and working together,
the three distinct systems provide the ability to monitor the status
of the experiment, protect the equipment and provide life
safety. Figure XXX indicates how these systems interact.

The DDSS system will be implemented through a combination of hardware
interlocks and the use of a programmable logic controller (PLC).
Listed below are some of \dword{dune} experimental conditions which will
require the intervention of the DDSS:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item A drop in the LAr level.  This condition requires a hardware
   interlock on the liquid level.  If the level drops below a
   pre-determined level, the drift high voltage must automatically be
   shut off to prevent equipment damage.  Slow Controls would be
   alerted to this condition through normal monitoring.
 \item Smoke, or a temperature/humidity rise above normal operating
   levels is detected inside of a rack or near an instrumented
   feedthrough.  If either of these conditions is detected, local
   power must be switched off. In the case that smoke is detected, a
   dry contact will alert FIRUS.
 \item A water leak detected near energized equipment in the DAQ
   underground data processing room.  Water leak detectors would
   report to the DDSS PLC and a decision will be made to either
   issue an alert or immediately shut power down to the room depending
   on the alert level detected.  This condition would also be reported
   to FIRUS.
\end{enumerate}
