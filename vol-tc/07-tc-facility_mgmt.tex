\chapter{Technical Coordination and Management at Facilities}
\label{vl:tc-facility_mgmt}

[Bill]

This needs to include how we manage teams from consortia
e.g. students, equipment, etc. We need to say what is provided by TC,
e.g. techs, engineers, tools, etc.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Technical coordination of activities SURF: This section includes what TC provides and how it interfaces with consortia work at SURF.
 \item Technical coordination of activities ITF: This section includes what TC provides and how it interfaces with consortia work at ITF.
 \item Technical coordination of activities at Ash River installation
   test site: This section includes what TC provides and how it
   interfaces with consortia work at Ash River (Should this go into
   APA? Or into Single Phase Installation and Integration?)
\end{enumerate}
