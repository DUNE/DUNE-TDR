\chapter{Detector Installation and Commissioning Organization}
\label{ch:tc-jpo}

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{vl:tc-global}, the \dword{ipd} has
responsibility for coordinating the planning and execution of 
the \dword{lbnf-dune} installation activities both 
in the underground detector caverns at \dword{surf} and 
nearby surface facilities.  The \dword{dune} consortia maintain 
responsibility for their subsystems over the course of these 
activities and provide the expert personnel and specialized 
equipment necessary to integrate, install, and commission their 
detector components.  Likewise, \dword{lbnf} has responsibility 
for activities associated with the installation 
of supporting infrastructure items, which are coordinated under 
the direction of the \dword{ipd}.       

The \dword{jpo} will evolve over time to incorporate the team in South 
Dakota responsible for the overall coordination of onsite
installation activities.  In the meantime, the installation team 
within the \dword{jpo} works directly with the \dword{dune} consortia 
and \dword{lbnf} project team members to plan out these activities.  
%\dword{jpo} installation team members are concurrently embedded within the \dword{dune} \dword{tc} organization during this period to facilitate required interactions with the \dword{dune} consortia. 

The \dword{jpo} installation planning team is 
responsible for specification and procurement of common infrastructure 
items associated with the installation of the detectors, 
which are not included within the scope of the \dword{dune} consortia.  
Some of these items are detector pieces such as racks, cable trays, cryostat 
flanges and mechanical structures for supporting the detectors within 
the cryostats.  Others are general items required for detector
installation such as clean rooms, cranes, scaffolding and personnel 
lifts.
%Within its support role, \dword{dune} \dword{tc} works closely with the \dword{jpo} team to characterize these items and contributes engineering resources for required design efforts.

The onsite \dword{jpo} team includes rigging 
teams responsible for moving materials in and out of the shaft, through the 
underground drifts, and within the detector caverns.  It includes
prersonnel responsible for overseeing safety and logistics planning.  These 
team members are anticpated to sit within the \dword{sdsd}, an organization 
formed to provide \dword{fnal} support services in South Dakota.    

\section{Far Site Safety}
\label{sec:far_site_safety}

The foundation of a credible installation plan is 
an \dword{esh} program that ensures the safety of particpating team 
members, the equipment supporting the program, and the environment 
at the \dword{surf} site.  The \dword{ipd} has direct responsibility 
for implementing the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} program for
the planned installation activities in South Dakota.  
The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager heads the onsite safety 
organization and reports directly to the \dword{ipd} to support
the execution of this responsibility.

The Far Site \dword{esh} coordinators sitting under the
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager oversee the day-to-day execution
of the installation work. As we move to full day installtion activity,
additional Far Site \dword{esh} coordinators will be assigned to each
work shift and serve as safety officers.  The safety officer assigned
to a particular shift is responsible for leading the safety
discussions that take place during the daily toolbox meeting and for
ensuring that all workers on that shift, including those from the
consortia or contractors, are properly trained.  The reporting chain for safety
incidents goes directly through the onsite safety team to the
\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} manager to minimize any potential
conflicts of interest.  All \dword{jpo} installation team members as
well as \dword{dune} consortia personnel and \dword{lbnf} project team
members have the right to stop work for any safety issues.

Documentation, including accident reports, near misses, weekly reports, 
equipment inspection, and training records is an important component of 
the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{esh} program.  Operation of all equipment 
used for  installation activities such as cranes, power 
tools, and personnel lifts is restricted to team members who have been
properly trained and certified for use of that equipment.  The safety 
coordinator for each shift is responsible for ensuring that all team 
personnel are properly trained and that safety documentation and work 
procedures are up-to-date and stored within the \dword{edms}.  

The work planning and \dword{ha} program utilizes detailed work plan
documents, \dword{ha} reports, equipment documentation, safety data
sheets, \dword{ppe} and job task training to mimimize work place
hazards and maximize efficiency.  Sample of this documentation is developed
through the \dword{ashriver} trial assembly process, which maps out
the step by step procedures and brings together the documenation
needed for approving the work plan.  The sample documentation is modified to
account for differences required for performing work underground and
the updated procedures are provided to the review process (as
discussed in Chapter~\ref{vl:tc-review}) for \dword{irr} and
\dwords{orr}.

\section{JPO Management}
\label{vl:tc-facility_mgmt}

The \dword{ipd} is responsible for coordinating all 
installation activities at \dword{surf} including those that fall 
under the direct responsibility of \dword{lbnf} and the \dword{dune} 
consortia.  The coordinators of the different activities and crucial 
technical support staff sit within the \dword{jpo}.  The organization
of this onsite team is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ash_river}.  
\begin{dunefigure}[Far Site Organization Chart]{fig:ash_river}
  {Far Site Organization Chart}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Org-Far-Site-TDR-6-29-19}
\end{dunefigure}
 
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:far_site_safety} an onsite safety 
organization incorporating the Far Site \dword{esh} coordinators
working under the direction of the \dword{lbnf-dune} 
\dword{esh} manager oversee all onsite activites and have a direct 
reporting line to the \dword{ipd}.  Due to the lack of surface space 
at \dword{surf}, a separate warehousing facility in the vicinity of 
\dword{surf} is required to receive and store materials in advance 
of their delivery to the undergound area.  Warehouse operations are 
coordinated by the \dword{lbnf-dune} logistics manager who is tasked 
with determining the exact sequence in which materials are delivered
into the underground areas.         

The underground caverns coordinator is responsible for managing all 
of the activities in the two undergound detector caverns and
the \dword{cuc}, this includes contracted workers.  Work within the detector caverns follows a time 
ordered sequence that includes installation of the cryostats (warm
and cold), cryogenic systems, and the detectors themselves.  Work 
in the \dword{cuc} includes installation of major cryogenic system 
pieces and the detector \dword{daq} electronics.  The underground 
caverns coordinator relies on separate installation teams focusing 
on cryostats, cryogenic systems, and the detectors.  The cryostat 
and cryogenics system installation teams are contracted resources 
provided by \dword{lbnf}.  For this reason, coordinators of these 
activities are embedded within both the \dword{lbnf} project team 
and the \dword{jpo}.  The detector installation teams incoporate a 
substantial number of scientific and technical personnel from the 
\dword{dune} consortia.  Coordinators of the detector installation 
effort sit directly within the \dword{jpo} during the period when 
these activities are being executed.  Any required improvements
to the detector caverns occuring after their beneficial 
occupancy are managed by the underground caverns coordinator  
under the direction of the \dword{ipd}.

The \dword{ipd} manages common technical and engineering resources 
to support the  installation activities.  Technical
resources include the support crews needed for rigging materials on and off the hoist 
at the top and bottom of the shaft, transporting materials to the
underground caverns from the bottom of the shaft, and rigging the 
detector and infrastructure pieces within the underground caverns 
during the installation process.  Additional, common technical 
resources used across the installation efforts are welders, 
survey teams, and cabling crews.  Access to on-call electricians, 
plumbers, and network technicians is also required to support 
the installation effort and deal with operational issues as they 
arise.  Required technical resources described here are provided 
through the \dword{sdsd}, which will host full-time staff members 
and contracted support staff to provide the necessary functions.     

Engineering resources for  installation activities 
sit directly within the \dword{jpo}.  The engineering team, which 
includes both mechanical and electrical engineers, is required to 
resolve last minute issues associated with component handling and 
detector grounding that arise over the course of the installation 
process.  Other required engineering functions include procurement
support, configuration managament, and particpation in the safety 
review process.

\subsection{South Dakota Warehouse Facility}

The \dword{sdwf} is a leased 5000m$^2$ facility hosted by the
\dword{sdsd}.  Approximately six months before \dword{aup}
of the underground detector caverns is received, the \dword{sdwf} 
is required to be in place for receiving cryostat and detector 
components.  Laydown space near the Ross headframe is extremely 
limited.  For this reason, the transportation of materials from 
the \dword{sdwf} to the top of the Ross shaft requires careful 
coordination. The \dword{lbnf-dune} logistics manager works with 
the \dword{cmgc}, through the end of excavation activities, and 
the other members of the \dword{jpo} team to coordinate transport 
of materials into the underground areas.  Since no materials or 
equipment can be shipped directly to the Ross or Yates headframes, 
the \dword{sdwf} is used for both short and long-term storage, as 
well as for any re-packaging of items required prior to transport 
into the underground areas. 

A small number of \dword{dune} consortia members work at
the \dword{sdwf} to check received components for potential damage 
incurred during shipment and track, using the inventory management 
system, all materials coming in and out of the facility.  In some 
cases re-packaging of materials is required for lowering them down
the shaft into the underground areas.  The \dword{dune} consortia
take responsibility for these efforts, which are additionally
supported by the \dword{sdwf} operations crew.   

\subsection{Underground Caverns}

As discussed in Sec.~\ref{vl:tc-facility_mgmt}, the installation 
process in the underground detector caverns and \dword{cuc} can 
be broken into a time-sequenced set of activities, coordinated 
through the \dword{jpo}.  In the detector caverns, installation 
of the warm and cold cryostat strucutres is followed by (with 
some overlap) installation of the cryogenic infrastructure and 
detectors.  In the \dword{cuc} installation of the \dword{daq}  
infrastructure and detector readout components proceeds in 
parallel with that of the cryogenic infrastructure.  A high-level 
schedule showing the inter-dependencies between these activities 
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:underground_schedule}.
\begin{dunefigure}[Underground summary schedule]{fig:underground_schedule}
  {Summary schedule or the different phases of work underground}
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{summary-schedule-tc}
\end{dunefigure}

The ability of \dword{lbnf-dune} to meet this schedule depends
critically on its ability to work within limitations on the total
number of people allowed in the underground areas at a given time as
well as occupancy limits on work in the cryostat.  In order to satisfy
these limitations, careful balancing of the numbers of workers
assigned to different concurrent tasks taking place within the
different underground caverns is required.  This is a particular
challenge during the excavation period for the second detector cavern,
which runs in parallel with cryostat installation in the first
detector cavern.  The \dword{jpo} works directly with its
\dword{lbnf-dune} project partners to manage and optimize the
underground work schedule so that interferences between concurrent
work efforts are minimized.

The underground cavern coordinator manages the contributions of 
the large technical team supporting the installation activities.
The size of the technical support team is anticipated to evolve  
over time to meet the needs of the specific installation tasks 
taking place.  The functions provided by the technical team 
supporting the work in the underground caverns includes the
following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {material transport:} Unloading of materials from the 
        trucks arriving from the \dword{sdwf}, loading or rigging 
        of materials at top of Ross Shaft, unloading or rigging 
        of materials at bottom of Ross Shaft, and delivery of 
        materials from the bottom of shaft to the underground 
        caverns.        
  \item {cavern rigging operations:}  Storage of 
        components within the available spaces at the bottom 
        of the cavern and movement of materials as required to 
        execute the installation process (three rigging stages
        for detector installation are moving components into 
        clean room, integrating components within clean room, 
        and installing integrated elements inside cryostat).
  \item {installation technicians:}  General technician 
        support for specific installation activities. 
  \item {welders, survey crews, and cabling teams:}  Perform 
        specific tasks incorporated within each of the different 
        installation efforts.
  \item {electrical technicians, plumbers, and network 
        specialists:}  On-call support staff to modify systems 
        as work transitions from one stage to the next and to 
        address issues as they arise.             
\end{itemize}   
    
The organization responsible for managing contributions of 
the technical support team to the  installation 
activities taking place in the underground caverns is shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:ctr_orgchart}.  The structure is illustrated
for the case of the largest anticipated workforce (approaching 
roughly sixty team members in total covering multiple shifts) 
for the periods with ongoing detector installation efforts.
These personnel support two 10-hour shifts on Mondays through 
Thursdays and a day shift on the remaining days to cover 
any activities occuring over the weekends. 
\begin{dunefigure}[Common Technical Resources]{fig:ctr_orgchart}
  {Summary of the \dword{jpo}/\dword{sdsd} Common Technical Resources}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Org_Technical_Resources-JPO-TDR-6-29-19}
\end{dunefigure}

On the surface at the start of each shift, there is a daily 
toolbox safety meeting and work assignment update. An hour 
separates the two shifts to allow ovelap between the shifts 
of the lead workers, safety officers, and other management 
team members, which facilitates the transfer of information 
from one shift to the next. The safety officer for each shift 
is responsible for conducting the safety discussion at the 
meeting and ensuring that all workers assigned to that shift 
have the proper trainings.

The team responsible for detector installation incorporates 
some members of the technical support team described above 
but also includes scientific and technical personnel from 
the \dword{dune} consortia.  The team is led by the detector 
installation manager who has three shift supervisors working 
with him or her to provide onsite coverage for every shift.
The management team works with the underground caverns 
coordinator to ensure that required technical support team 
members are available as needed and that required materials 
are delivered to the detector caverns on a schedule to keep
the installation effort moving forward.         

The management team supervises technical resources assigned to 
the detector installation effort and also works with the consortia 
team members to maximize the overall efficiency of the installation 
process.  The organizational structure used to manage the detector 
integration activities is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:uit_orgchart}.
\begin{dunefigure}[Underground Detector Integration/Installation Team]{fig:uit_orgchart}
  {The \dword{uit}}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Org_UIT-TDR-6-29-19}
\end{dunefigure}

The detector installation manager oversees all shifts but also 
covers as the supervisor for specific shifts as needed.  This 
individual serves as the direct contact with the underground caverns 
coordinator for obtaining required technical support
team members and organizing the delivery of needed materials 
into the detector caverns.  The detector installation manager 
attends all high-level meetings and is tasked with submitting
weekly progress reports.  This individual also works with the 
\dword{dune} consortia to manage the overall work schedule 
and ensure that the correct resources are in the right place
at the right time. 
    
The installation supervisors are working managers, trained as 
riggers and equipment operators to fill in as needed on their 
shifts.  They are fully trained in all installation procedures
and work with the consortia shift team members to keep the 
installation effort on schedule.  Installation Supervisors 
fill in for their lead workers as needed and are the primary 
points of contact for information that needs to be exchanged 
between shifts.  Lead workers are the main equipment operators 
and direct the technical support personnel assigned for their 
shift.  The lead workers are also trained in all installation 
procedures and provide assistance to the consortia work teams 
as needed.  

\subsection{\dword{ashriver}}

\dword{ashriver} is the site of the \dword{nova} far detector in \dword{ashriver},
Minnesota, USA. The \dword{nova} far site detector hall offers a \SI{16.75}{m} 
deep pit with $\sim$\SI{300}{m$^2$} of floor space available for 
testing full-scale \dword{dune} detector components.  The trial assembly 
work at \dword{ashriver} focuses on mechanical tests of the complete installation
process for \dword{dune}. It confirms designs,
including modifications originating from \dword{protodune}, 
in both the cleanroom and cryostat and practices installation techniques.  As described below, the 
work is divided into three major phases.  The \dword{nova} Far 
Detector Laboratory is managed by the University of Minnesota 
and is partially funded through an operations contract from 
\dword{fnal}.  Work performed at the \dword{ashriver} site follows both 
university and \dword{fnal} safety regulations, whichever is more 
stringent. University code officials approve all building permits, 
which include engineered drawings signed by an engineer registered 
in Minnesota. All hazard analyses and work procedure documents are 
approved by a joint safety committee with members drawn from both 
the University of Minnesota and \dword{fnal} \fixme{and \dword{dune}?} that includes specialists 
as needed.

The work at \dword{ashriver} has five main goals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item using prototype \dword{dune} components, verify that the \dword{dune} detector can be installed 
    in a safe and efficient manner,
    \item test all installation equipment needed to install the \dword{dune} detector at \dword{surf},
  \item validate mechanical design changes made to the detector
    elements subsequent to \dword{protodune} operation,
  \item complete a set of reviewed engineering and procedural documents that will serve 
    as the basis for work to be performed underground at 
    \dword{surf}, and 
  \item serve as a training center for personnel who will 
    contribute to \dword{dune}  installation at \dword{surf}.
\end{itemize}

There is a full time staff of five personnel at \dword{ashriver}
including a manager, deputy manager, and three experienced technicians
that all participated in \dword{pdsp} installation at \dword{cern} and
the \dword{pdsp} trial assembly at \dword{ashriver}.  The staff
oversees operations of the \dword{nova} detector and performs trial
assembly studies of the \dword{dune} detector components.  One of the
three technicians also serves as the site safety officer and
chairperson of the joint safety committee.  Two additional staff
members will be added in the near future to handle the additional
workload associated with preparations for the \dword{protodune2}
installation effort.

\begin{dunefigure}

  the \dword{pdsp} trial assembly structure.}
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{ashriver_tower}
\end{dunefigure}
The three major phases of \dword{ashriver} program are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {Phase 0:} A vertical cabling test using two full-scale 
         \dword{apa} side tubes connected top to bottom and mounted 
         against a vertical column in the detector hall.  Using this 
         setup the proposed cable bundles have been run through the 
         tubes to see how well the designed conduit system functions.
         This work has led to several proposed modifications to the 
         designs which are currently being considered.  The older 
         \dword{protodune} trial assembly structure is concurrently 
         being used to perform mechanical tests of \dword{protodune2} 
         components. 
  \item {Phase 1:} A prototype of the \dword{dune} \dword{apa} 
         assembly tower using a steel frame large enough to hold a 
         commercial stair scaffold within its mid-section as shown 
         in Figure~\ref{fig:ashriver1} is being constructed.  The 
         tower is designed to test the process for connecting top 
         and bottom \dword{apa} pairs together and installing the 
         required cable bundles.  The next step will be to add a
         \dword{cpa} assembly station and test assembly procedures 
         for the updated \dword{cpa} designs.  A prototype 
         \dword{apa} shipping frame is also being constructed to 
         test the mechanical features of the shipping container 
         design.  
  \item {Phase 2:} A more complex steel structure will be 
         designed and fabricated to mock up the network of rails 
         and support structures used to install the \dword{dune}
         \dword{fd} modules including pieces of the \dword{dss}, 
         which sits inside the cryostat.  This structure as 
         illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ashriver2} will provide 
         a platform for performing more detailed tests of the 
         proposed detector installation plan.  Installation steps 
         to be tested include \dword{dss} installation, transfer 
         of \dword{tpc} components through the \dword{tco}, 
         installation of the \dword{tpc} end walls, cabling 
         through the cryostat penetrations, movement of the 
         \dword{apa} and  \dword{cpa} pairs into their final 
         positions, and deployment of the top and bottom field 
         cage modules.
\end{itemize}

\section{South Dakota Services Division}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-host_facility_services}

\dword{fnal} has established the \dword{sdsd} to support integration 
and installation activities in South Dakota. \dword{sdsd} will support 
these activities, which are the responsibility of the \dword{ipd}, 
by providing access to the required technical resources.  These 
resources include dedicated \dword{fnal} personnel sitting within 
the division and contracted labor provided through the division.   

\dword{sdsd} is responsible for badging and access to the leased 
areas at \dword{surf}. This includes providing and coordinating  
the trainings required to access surface and underground areas.  
\dword{sdsd} also takes on the responsibility for performing 
regular inspections and maintenance of \dword{lbnf-dune} equipment 
at \dword{surf} including lifts, conveyances, networking equipment, 
cooling and ventillation equipment, electrical power installations, 
life safety systems, and controlled access equipment.  Contracts 
that need to be written for conventional facilities procurements 
after the \dword{lbnf} conventional facilities contractor leaves 
the site will also be handled through the \dword{sdsd}.
